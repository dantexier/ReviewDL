The emergence of Web 2.0 systems has enabled a lightweight knowledge-modeling approach based on techniques such as community tagging, clustering, and community authoring. Hard semantic technologies provide ways to express meanings of resources and their relationships in machine processable formats, and ways to draw conclusions. Soft semantic technologies provide ways to express the meanings of resources in formats that humans can interpret, or in formats that employ domain-specific information structures. Semantic technologies could address curriculum development or alignment, student retention, data transparency, degree program accreditation, interaction with funding bodies, and cross-institutional collaboration.

More precisely, to identify - in general terms, rather than specifically - the important competencies required by information professionals in creating and managing digital libraries, and in facilitating their use, and to assess how these competencies are treated in LIS education and training, and therefore how the capacities of the information professions are being developed. Design/methodology/approach - Literature analysis of the skill sets required by librarians working with digital materials. Evaluation of formal education and of professional development programmes in the UK and in Slovenia, to assess how these needs are being met. Findings - Both formal education and continuing development training are adapting to cover aspects of the digital library environment, both in the UK and in Slovenia. This is happening as part of the normal process of the redesign of degree programmes and of training courses. Digital library skills and knowledge - embodying conceptual, semantic, syntactic and technical aspects - are being included in existing courses, for the most part, rather than in entities labelled ""digital library"". This approach has strengths and also weaknesses. While there is some agreement on core topics, there is much variation in how they are presented, and in the relative importance given to them. Research limitations/implications - Based on comparison of education and training programmes in two countries, the UK and Slovenia. Practical implications - Recommendations for curricula are made. Originality/value - Provides an insight into education and training needs in a developing and important area. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Digital libraries, Education and training, International standards, Professional education, Slovenia, United Kingdom,Curricula, Information analysis, Information science, Personnel training, Professional aspects, Semantics, Standards, Syntactics, International standards, Professional education, Slovenia, United Kingdom, Digital libraries,,,,,,"Bawden, D., Rowlands, I., Digital libraries: Assumptions and concepts (1999) Libri, 49 (4), pp. 181-191; Bawden, D., Vilar, P., Zabukovec, V., (2004), ""Competences and capacities for the digital library"", paper presented at Libraries in the Digital Age (LIDA) 2004, Dubrovnik, 26 MayBorgman, C.L., Why are online catalogs hard to use?

Compares information behaviour of British university academics in three disciplines - computer and information sciences, business/management, and English literature. Design/methodology/approach - Discusses information behaviour of academics in the digital age. Findings - English academics make higher use of printed information resources, such as text and reference books, than academics of any other discipline included in this study; they generally tended to be the least frequent users of electronic resources such as full-text databases, indexing and abstracting databases, search engines, and internet sites. CIS academics generally tended to make greatest use of electronic-based information resources, and the least use of print-based information resources, and business/management academics fell somewhere in between these two disciplines. CIS academics were generally the most enthusiastic about the benefits of electronic resources, whereas English academics were the least enthusiastic about them. Nearly a quarter of English academics disagreed to some extent that electronic information was easier to use than printed resources, which might go some way to explain their lower use of electronic materials, and higher use of printed materials. Research limitations/implications - Results of the quantitative study should have been supported and substantiated by quantitative analyses. Similar studies involving users from many more disciplines could show better discipline-wise differences in user behaviour.

We reviewed the applications intended to complement traditional curriculum materials for K-12. We found 87 research articles on augmented reality learning experiences (ARLEs) in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and other learning technology publications. Forty-three of these articles conducted user studies, and seven allowed the computation of an effect size to the performance of students in a test. In our meta-analysis, research show that ARLEs achieved a widely variable effect on student performance from a small negative effect to a large effect, with a mean effect size of 0.56 or moderate effect. To complement this finding, we performed a qualitative analysis on the design aspects for ARLEs: display hardware, software libraries, content authoring solutions, and evaluation techniques. We explain that AR incur three inherent advantages: real world annotation, contextual visualization, and vision-haptic visualization. We illustrate these advantages through the exemplifying prototypes, and ground these advantages to multimedia learning theory, experiential learning theory, and animate vision theory. Insights from this review are aimed to inform the design of future ARLEs. © 2013 IEEE.",Augmented reality learning experience, Evaluation method, Learning theory, Meta,analysis, Prototyping,Augmented reality, Curricula, Design, Digital libraries, Software prototyping, Educational settings, Evaluation method, Experiential learning theories, Learning experiences, Learning Theory, Meta,analysis, Multimedia learning theory, Reality learning, Engineering education,,,,,,"(2012) Advanced Learning Technologies Journal List, , http://celstec.org/content/advanced-learning-technologies-journal-list; (2012) Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (Imi), , http://www.selfdeterminationtheory.org/questionnaires/10-questionnaires/ 50; (2012) What Is Contextual Learning?, , http://www.cord.org/contextual-learning-definition/, Oct; (2012) Zooburst: Create Your Own Interactive 3D Pop-Up Books, , http://www.zooburst.com/, Oct; Alavi, M., Computer-mediated collaborative learning: An empirical evaluation (1994) MIS Quarterly, 18 (2), pp. 159-174; Annetta, L., Bronack, S., Serious educational game assessment: Practical methods and models for educational games (2011) Simulations and Virtual Worlds.

In the fall of 2002 more than 100 students created 1400 concept maps as part of selected computing classes offered at the University of Arizona and Virginia Tech. Those students conducted searches, obtained course information, created concept maps, collaborated in acquiring knowledge, and presented their knowledge representations. This article connects the design elements of the GetSmart system to targeted concept-map-based learning processes, describes our system and research testbed, and analyzes our system usage logs. Results suggest that students did in fact use the tools in an integrated fashion, combining knowledge representation and search activities. After concept mapping was included in the curriculum, we observed improvement in students' online quiz scores. Further, we observed that students in groups collaboratively constructed concept maps with multiple group members viewing and updating map details. © 2007 ACM.",Concept maps, Digital libraries, Education,Concept maps, GetSmart systems, Information search process, Education, Information analysis, Knowledge acquisition, Knowledge representation, Learning systems, Students, Digital libraries,,,,,,"AUSUBEL, D.P., (1968) Educational Psychology: A Ccognitive View, , Rinehart and Winston, New York; CANAS, A.J., LEAKE, D.B., WILSON, D.C., Managing, mapping and manipulating conceptual knowledge: Exploring the synergies of knowledge management & case-based reasoning (1999) Proceedings of the AAAI Workshop on Exploring Synergies of Knowledge Management and Case-based Reasoning, pp. 10-14. , Menlo Park, CA; CHEN, S.-W., LIN, S.C., CHANG, K.E., Attributed concept maps: Fuzzy integration and fuzzy matching (2001) IEEE Trans.

Digital library users have requested that this information be accessible in association with digital learning resources to support teaching and learning as well as accountability requirements. Providing this information is complex because of the variability and number of standards documents in use at the national, state, and local level. This article describes a cataloging tool that aids catalogers in the assignment of standards metadata to digital library resources, using natural language processing techniques. The research explores whether the standards suggestor service would suggest the same standards as a human, whether relevant standards are ranked appropriately in the result set, and whether the relevance of the suggested assignments improve when, in addition to resource content, metadata is included in the query to the cataloging tool. The article also discusses how this service might streamline the cataloging workflow. © 2010 ASIS&T.",,Cataloging tool, Computer assisted, Curriculum designs, Digital learning resources, Educational standards, Educational systems, Library resources, NAtural language processing, Teacher professional development, Teaching and learning, Computational linguistics, Curricula, Digital libraries, Metadata, Natural language processing systems, Standardization,,,,,,"Blank, R.K., (1997) Mathematics and Science Content Standards and Curriculum Frameworks: States Progress on Development and Implementation: 1997, , State Education Assessment Center.

Through the years, we have continued to facilitate college faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines to stay current with HPC methodologies. We have accomplished this by designing and delivering faculty workshops, hosted in a variety of lab settings, as well as by developing tools supporting the technical infrastructure necessary for HPC education, all this without requiring access to traditional HPC computing platforms. In all, we have so far presented 16 professional development workshops for close to 400 predominantly undergraduate STEM faculty. This paper presents the result of internal formative evaluation by workshop instructors and the materials and tools developed during that process. We did this work as part of the National Computational Science Institute (NCSI) and in collaboration with the following groups: The Minority Serving Institutions - High Performance Computing (MSI-HPC) program of the National Computational Science Alliance The Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges (CCSC) The Center for Excellence in High Performance Computing The Oklahoma University Supercomputing Symposium series The Super Computing (SC) conference series education program We presented learners with a sequence of interactive, ""run it, modify it, build it"" open-ended lab exercises drawn from a variety of disciplines. Interactivity means having the ability to change parallel and algorithmic parameters, e.g. running software on more than one machine, using different models, refining the model, changing the problem scale, using different parallel algorithms. There is a lack of scientific parallel curricula suitable for illustrating Computational Science principles in the classroom. We addressed this need by locating, and where necessary creating, suitable open source software, data-sets, and curricular support materials related to typical problems in STEM disciplines. We use two methods to address the lack of educational HPC infrastructure of most institutions. Via a workstation reboot, the Bootable Cluster CD (BCCD) temporarily transforms a pre-existing Windows or Macintosh laboratory into a computational cluster in under five minutes. Second, we have prototyped an easily portable, airline checkable, under $3000, 8 node cluster for delivering HPC education anywhere with a standard electrical outlet. All the described curriculum materials and software are available through the Shodor Foundation's Computational Science Education Reference Desk (CSERD), one of the pathway projects of the National Science Foundation's National Science Digital Library (NSDL).

Consequently, significant changes have occurred in nursing area including holding computer skills courses, digital library workshops, establishing web sites in hospitals, and developing information technology (IT) training in nursing students' curriculum to increase accessibility to best practice information and opportunity for nurses and students to use research-based information in their clinical decision. So a question has raised, what information resources are used by nursing staff and students in hospitals? The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 412 nurses and students working in hospitals connected to web and digital libraries participated. They are evaluated with a questionnaire. Findings: The results indicated that the students and the nurses preferred experiential knowledge to research-based information in their clinical decisions and they had little tendency to high-level evidence. Results showed that lack of skill in using library was the most important deterrent in using research-based information. Originality/value: It could be concluded that provision of the infrastructures for using research-based information in clinical decisions was not sufficient. In addition to infrastructures, the paper must invest on organizational, system-wide approaches such as organizational culture, information literacy culture, acceptance of innovation, role of clinical librarians and advanced nursing informatics, and social marketing in evidence-based practice to facilitate the use of higher-level evidence in practice. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Digital library, Health, Information, Information technology, Iran, Nurses, Seeking strategies, Students,,,,,,,"Bertulis, R., Barriers to accessing evidence-based information (2008) Nursing Standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain): 1987, 22, pp. 35-39; Bryant, S.L., The information needs and information seeking behavior of family doctors (2004) Health Inf.

We all know how to create educational content, including interactive Java applets, and deliver them via the Web. Working groups are currently drafting standards for organizing learning objects in digital libraries. The vision is clear: developers will share their modules within repositories, and educators will select the best-fitting modules for their own courses, just in time, just in place. This article examines related obstacles with interactive learning objects and outlines possible ways to overcome them. Even the creation of a single self-contained interactive module with didactical value is time consuming and expensive. Its use (and reuse) entails further requirements. Educators would like to adapt layout, appearance, or functionality to their curriculum. Learners would like to ask questions in discussion boards referring to specific configurations, and explore and share their own setups. How can we reuse highly interactive learning objects, particularly in terms of adaptability and interoperability? We review how reusable software components and a scripting architecture allow for creating interactive learning objects that are adaptable in all aspects and interoperable with other learning objects. Next, we discuss how we may enable developers, educators, and learners - respectively, a courseware's ""community"" - to share efforts and collaborate in getting highly interactive Web-based courseware off the ground. Authors may define and modify scripts using online wizards. We present a prototype script database that is rated, annotated, and extended by community members, and close with showcases in the areas of Computer Graphics and Visualization. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, previous studies of such alignment use single-dimensional and binary measures of the alignment concept. As a consequence, they suffer from low inter-rater reliability (IRR), with experts agreeing about alignments only some 20-40% of the time. We present the results of an experiment in which the alignment variable was operationalized using the Saracevic model of relevance 'clues' taken from the everyday practice of K-12 teaching. Results show high IRR across all clues with IRR on several specific alignment dimensions significantly higher than on overall alignment. In addition, a model of overall alignment is derived and estimated. The structure and explanatory power of the model as well as the relationships between alignment clues differ significantly between alignments of curriculum found by users themselves and curriculum found by others. These results illustrate the usefulness of clue-based relevance measures for information retrieval and have important consequences for both the formulation of automated retrieval mechanisms and the construction of a gold standard or benchmark set of standard-curriculum alignments. © 2009.",Alignment, Educational standard, Gold standard, Information retrieval, Inter,rater reliability, Relevance,Alignment concept, Educational digital libraries, Educational standards, Explanatory power, Gold standard, Gold standards, Key objective, Mathematics education, Relevance measure, Curricula, Digital libraries, Gold, Information retrieval, Information services, Reliability, Standards, Alignment,,,,,,"Baeza-Yates, R., Ribiero-Neto, B., (1999) Modern information retrieval, , Addison Wesley - ACM Press, Harlow, UK; Bar-Ilan, J., Keenoy, K., Yaari, E., Levene, M., User rankings of search engine results (2007) Journal of the American Society of Information Science and Technology, 58, pp. 1254-1266; Blumenthal, D., (2003) Evaluation approaches for a K-12 digital library collection, , http://eduimpact.comm.nsdl.org/evalworkshop/blumenthal.doc, WGBH Educational Foundation, Boston, MA <http://eduimpact.comm.nsdl.org/evalworkshop/blumenthal.doc> Accessed 12.03.08; Borsboom, D., Mellenbergh, G.J., van Heerden, J., The theoretical status of latent variables (2003) Psychological Review, 110, pp. 203-219; Borsboom, D., Latent variable theory (2008) Measurement, 6, pp. 25-53; Borlund, P., The concept of relevance in IR (2003) Journal of the American Society of Information Science and Technology, 54, pp. 913-925; Breen, C., (2008) Review: Nettrekker, , http://www.macworld.com/article/134787/2008/08/nettrekker.html, Accessed 12.03.08; Cosijn, E., Ingwersen, P., Dimensions of relevance (2000) Information Processing and Management, 36, pp. 533-550; Cosijn, E., Bothma, T., Contexts of relevance for information retrieval system design (2005) CoLIS 2005, pp. 47-48. , Crestani F., and Ruthven I.

Design/methodology/approach: The researchers systemically surveyed and reviewed publications related to information literacy and library user education. Findings: It was found that a well-designed information literacy program benefits the library and its staff, faculty, and students; librarians should play a leading role in the design and operation of programs, but collaboration with faculty, IT professionals and students is essential; programs should be embedded in the curriculum, be largely cooperative, and be problem-based; evaluation and assessment are essential components; emphasis should be placed on first-year students; and, ideally, the librarians will turn into educators and the library will become a learning center combining learning, research and technology. Research limitations/implications: This paper reflects the opinions of the researchers and the authors of the reviewed literature who have insights into the issues related to information literacy and library user education. These opinions present useful guidelines for both librarian and teacher practitioners. Originality/value: This paper provides a point of view on the relationship between information literacy and library user education in the six themes described above. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Electronic document delivery, Information literacy, Library tutorial, Library user education, University libraries,Design and operations, Design/methodology/approach, Electronic document delivery, Essential component, Evaluation and assessment, First year students, Information literacy, IT professional, Learning center, Library user education, Library users, Problem,based, Research limitations, University libraries, Curricula, Engineering research, Information services, Libraries, Students, Teaching, Word processing, Digital libraries,,,,,,"Akeroyd, J., The management of change in electronic libraries (2001) IFLA Journal, 27 (2), pp. 70-73; Presidential Committee on Information Literacy (1999), www.ala.org/acrl/nili/nlit1st.html, Final Report, Chicago, available at (accessed 27 January 2009) American Library AssociationArmstrong, A., First-year experience research skills survey (2003) Assessing Student Learning Outcomes for Information Literacy Instruction in Academic Institutions, pp. 53-59. , Avery, E.

In this paper, we report on our work towards creating a syllabus repository of Computer Science courses across universities in the USA. We present some statistics from our initial collection of 8000+ syllabi. We show a syllabus creator that is integrated with Moodle [5], an opensource course management system, which allows for the creation of a syllabus for a particular course. Among other information, it includes knowledge units from the Computing Curricula 2001 body of knowledge. The goal of the syllabus repository is to provide added value to the Computer Science Education community, and we present some such offerings. We conclude by presenting our future plans for the syllabus repository. These include using automated techniques to collect and classify syllabi, providing recommendations to instructors when creating a syllabus, and allowing the community to share their syllabi automatically. The syllabus collection will be part of the Computing and Information Technology Interactive Digital Educational Library (CITIDEL), a collection of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL).

Access to e-books continues to develop, with numerous platforms available, and lack of standardisation an ongoing problem. However, there are potential advantages to e-books, including easier access, speed of publication, space-saving, and lower costs. Many university libraries are beginning to have e-books in their collections. A research project being undertaken at Liverpool John Moores University is investigating the provision of e-books in 127 academic libraries in the UK. Many academic libraries are providing access to e-book resources that are free-of-charge, and those libraries offering e-book subscriptions are using the World Wide Web for their platform. There are similar issues in the take-up of e-books to those regarding the take-up of other electronic resources, such as e-ACjournals. These include changes in professional and management skills, such as collection development, marketing and evaluation, user education, technological skills and communication skills.",Academic libraries, Collections management, Electronic books, Librarians, Research, United Kingdom,Curricula, Digital libraries, Education, Electronic commerce, Information technology, Marketing, Research, Search engines, Students, Academic libraries, Collections management, Electronic books, Librarians, Internet,,,,,,"Armstrong, C., Edwards, L., Lonsdale, R., Virtually there?

Das A.,Emergence of open educational resources (OER) in India and its impact on lifelong learning,2011,Library Hi Tech News,28,5,,10,15,,6,10.1108/07419051111163848,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2,s2.0,79961072144&partnerID=40&md5=6b4df038313ba9104281d9d75a8559d1,"Centre for Studies in Science Policy, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India","Das, A., Centre for Studies in Science Policy, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India","Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the evolution of open educational resources OER initiatives in India - how OER movement emerges from the open access movement in the backdrop of an emerging knowledge-based economy. This paper also illustrates how OER help in democratizing lifelong learning spaces that eventually help in skills development. Design/methodology/approach: This paper primarily uses baseline surveys and recommendations of different working groups of Indian National Knowledge Commission. Relevant policy instruments of the Ministry of Human Resources Development, UNESCO, International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions and other national and international bodies are also critically examined to understand India's stand on OER in comparison with other promising developing countries. This paper analyses impact of OER on Indian systems of education, ranging from lifelong learning, technical and vocational education and training to higher education systems. This paper also illustrates various models of innovations which are shaping up multi-dimensional lifelong learning pathways to cater to career aspirations of young Indians. Findings: This paper finds out that Indian OER initiatives make use of textual platforms as well as audio-visual platforms embracing YouTube, Metacafe and other web-based streaming video channels. This paper also illustrates the collaboration patterns in OER initiatives in order to attain sustainability, optimum usage and integration with formal curriculum of skills development programmes. Research limitations/implications: Although this paper identifies external as well as internal factors that are shaping up OER movement in this emerging knowledge economy, this paper mainly focuses on country-level initiatives. The challenges faced at the institutional level as well as users level can be traced through advanced research studies. Practical implications: This paper suggests some sustainable models for OER deployment, lessons learned and challenges faced by practitioners and users communities. Social implications: OER development has become a social movement. Proper deployment and utilization of OER resources will lead to social empowerment of young adults. This paper helps in understanding how Indian society embraces OER in order to attain social justice and empowerment through sustainable educational development. Originality/value: This paper is a unique attempt to produce a state-of-the-art report on the emergence of the OER movement in a transitional emerging economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Educational digital libraries, India, Knowledge economy, Knowledge society, Lifelong learning, Open access to knowledge, Open courseware, Open educational resources, South Asia,,,,,,,"Das, A.K., (2008) Open Access to Knowledge and Information: Scholarly Literature and Digital Library Initiatives - The South Asian Scenario, , UNESCO, New Delhi; Ghosh, S.B., Das, A.K., Open access and institutional repositories: A developing country perspective - a case study of India (2007) IFLA Journal, 33 (3), pp. 229-250; (2009) National Mission on Education Through Information and Communication Technology (NME-ICT): Mission Document, , www.education.nic.in/dl/MissionDocument.pdf, MHRD India, available at, (accessed 31 August 2010); (2009) National Policy on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in School Education (Draft Policy), , http://education.nic.in/secedu/ict.pdf, MHRD India, available at, (accessed 31 August 2010); (2009) National Policy on Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), , http://education.nic.in/secedu/RMSA280709/RMSA.pdf, MHRD India, available at, (accessed 31 August 2010); Krishnan, M.S., (2009) NPTEL: A programme for free online and open engineering and science education, , paper presented at the International Conference on Technology for Education (T4E 2009), Radha Regent Hotel, Bangalore, 4-6 August; Raghavan, S.V., (2009) National knowledge network: Concept, design and realisation, , www.euindiagrid.eu/index.php/articles-section1/8-state-of-the-art/73-national-knowledge-network, available at, (accessed 31 August 2010); Subbiah, A., Open access in India: Hopes and frustrations (2008) Proceedings of the Conference on Electronic Publishing (ELPUB 2008), Toronto, Canada, June 2008, pp. 271-279. , http://elpub.scix.net/data/works/att/271_elpub2008.content.pdf, available at","Das, A.; Centre for Studies in Science Policy, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India; email: anupdas2072@gmail.com",,,,,,,,7419058,,,,English,Libr.

Design/methodology/approach: The survey was carried out in two parts: first, a survey of web sites maintained by library schools was conducted to identify any DL course offered and also to analyze the course contents, followed by e-mail messages containing three research questions to library and information science (LIS) faculty members to ascertain the availability of DL courses in the curriculum. Findings: Results from the survey revealed that only a few library schools offer courses specifically related to DLs. Many library schools have not developed DL as a standalone course in their LIS curriculum; rather, it is briefly discussed as a topic in related courses. The reason for this is that the LIS departments lack the facilities and qualified personnel to teach a course on DL. More than 45 library schools were investigated, among them 20 institutions offering DL courses or related courses. Originality/value: The results from the study presented in this paper will provide important data and insight into the current state of DL education in African library schools, and generate suggestions for educators and policy makers for developing and including ""DLs"" as a standalone course in the LIS curriculum. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Africa, Digital libraries, Education, Library studies,Africa, Course contents, Design/methodology/approach, Digital Libraries (DLs), Faculty members, Library and information science, Qualified personnel, Research questions, Curricula, Digital libraries, Education, Societies and institutions, Surveys, Teaching,,,,,,"(1995) Definition and Purpose of a Digital Library, , www.ifla.org/documents/libraries/net/art-dlib.txt, Association of Research Libraries, available at, (accessed June 23, 2009), Association of Research Libraries, Washington, DC; Borgman, C.L., What are digital libraries?

The new paradigm of ICT in educations is smart services, which enhances the education efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. The education smart services in Thailand, called NEdNet (National Education Network), are integrated systems including network infrastructure services, education information services (EIS), and Learning services, which facilitator of higher-order thinking skills, support learner-centered, self-directed learning, tailored learning and decision supporting. The first part of NEdNet is network infrastructure systems. Ministry of Education proposed National Education Network (NEdNet) project to develop national education network and provide enough bandwidth for all levels of education. NEdNet is the integration of UniNet Network [6] for higher education, MOENet for schools and VECNet for vocational institutes. NEdNet supports usage of the entire education system with the following bandwidth 1) 293 university connected by dark fiber, which will have bandwidth 1-10 Gbps, 2) 415 vocational institutions, which will have bandwidth 100-1,000 Mbps, and finally 3,000 schools, which will have bandwidth 10-100 Mbps. NEdNet also investigates the coming technology such as 3G, WiMax and FTTx for last mile access networks. NEdNet provides either community internet or research education network (REN), which connected to Internet2 in USA., JGN2 in Japan, TEIN (Trans Eurasia Information Network) and APAN (Asia Pacific Advanced Network). The second part of the NEdNet is education information services (EIS) using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) infrastructure, which provides information for management and executives in three levels. The first level is national level, which establishes a comprehensive e-government project using TH e-Gif (Thailand e-Government Interoperability Framework) [1] to enhance efficiency and quality of general services such as procurement, service delivery, monitoring and evaluation and etc. The second is local level, which shares data and information among education administration organizations and other government departments. The last is school level, which handles education administration in a more efficient, convenient, and innovative way. The last part of NEdNet is Learning services, which provides cloud computing facilities for cyber learning system, digital library (ThaiLis) and educational broadcasting services called E-TV and Teacher TV (IP-TV). These services provide education resources for economically and geographically disadvantaged students and Thailand Cyber University (TCU) for adults to promote lifelong learning. in conclusion, NEdNet is the education smart services, which can contribute to learning outcomes of traditional curriculum domains and can play a greater role in the future education. The network infrastructure decreases students digital-divided in Internet and research networks. The other services are more relevant to quality of education resources, extending learning beyond classrooms, student-centered learning and national competitiveness. © 2011 IEEE.",Education information system, Education smart services, Future education, Service oriented architecture,Advanced networks, Broadcasting service, Computing facilities, Data and information, Decision supporting, e,Government, Education networks, Education resource, Education systems, Eurasia, Future education, Government departments, Higher education, Higher order, Information communication technology, Information networks, Integrated systems, Internet2, Interoperability framework, Last mile access networks, Learner,centered, Learning outcome, Learning services, Life long learning, Ministry of Education, National competitiveness, National level, Network infrastructure, Quality of education, Research networks, Self,directed learning, Service delivery, Service Oriented, Smart services, Student,centered learning, Thailand, Thinking skills, Bandwidth, Cloud computing, Competition, Curricula, Digital libraries, Electrochemical corrosion, Government data processing, Information dissemination, Information management, Information retrieval, Information services, Information technology, Internet, Internet protocols, Interoperability, Learning systems, Network architecture, Service oriented architecture (SOA), Societies and institutions, Teaching, Telecommunication networks, Wimax, Students,,,,,,"Saekow, A., Boonmee, C., Towards a practical approach for electronic government interoperability framework (e-GIF) (2009) Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 1-9. , hicss, 42nd; Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Protocols, , http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/internetworking/technology/handbook/ OSI-Protocols.html, available as; Rosen, E., Rekhter, Y., Bgp/mpls vpns (1999) RFC 2547, , http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2547.txt, available as, March; Newcomer, E., Lomow, G., (2005) Understanding SOA with Web Services, , Pearson Education, (first edition); Mao, Y., Li, Z., Research on web services application in distance education platform construction (2009) Computational Intelligence and Software Engineering, 2009.

These modules will be evaluated, first through expert inspection and, second, through field testing. We are identifying and refining module definitions and scopes, collecting related resources, developing a module template, and creating example modules. These will be presented at the conference.

The survey data sample is made of 117 courses spreading over 58 higher-education institutions across 13 European countries and involving (at least) 91 academic staff. A total number of 364 websites have been browsed which are accessible from the electronic (HTML) version of the paper in the form of links to course websites, lecturers and topic entries in encyclopedias or virtual libraries. Three main projections of our sample are briefly analysed. Although far from being fully representative, these already provide some useful indicators about the impact of formal methods in European curricula on computing. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,Curricula, Digital libraries, Formal methods, Surveys, Teaching, Websites, Academic staff, European Countries, Higher education, Survey data, Virtual libraries, Education,,,,,,"Abrial, J.-R., (1996) The B-book: Assigning Programs to Meanings, , Cambridge University Press; Bowen, J., (2004) World Wide Web Virtual Library of Formal Methods, , http://www.afm.sbu.ac.uk; Cuadrado, J., Teach formal methods (1994) Byte, p. 292. , December; Fitzgerald, J., Larsen, P.G., (1998) Modelling Systems: Practical Tools and Techniques for Software Development, , Cambridge University Press, 1st edition; Hansen, M.R., Rischel, H., (1999) Introduction to Programming Using SML, , Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-39820-6; Holzmann, G.J., (2003) The Spin Model Checker: Primer and Reference Manual, , Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-321-22862-6, 608 pages; Peyton Jones, S.L., (2003) Haskell 98 Language and Libraries, , Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK; (2003) Journal of Functional Programming, 13 (1 SPEC.

This contribution aims to pursue the need to consider affect and an affective paradigm more prominently in the design, evaluation, promotion and use of IRS and library and information services (LIS). Design/methodology/approach: The contribution is written against the background of research in information behaviour, user studies, systems design, and information literacy. Findings: Although the literature from LIS and other disciplines notes an affective paradigm or even paradigms, it is not strongly positioned compared with the systems and cognitive paradigms. A growing body of research and work practices such as information representation and tagging, and information skills training, is taking a slant towards affect and emotion. The question, however, is whether current work is sufficient to argue for an affective paradigm complementary to the systems, cognitive and socio-cognitive paradigms, and how an affective paradigm should be introduced in training/education for LIS. Originality/value: Although there are a number of publications on affect and emotion, and references to an affective paradigm, this contribution is aimed at stimulating thought on whether we should prominently introduce the affective paradigm into LIS curricula as preparation for adding more value to IRS, library services, and in dealing with emotion-laden jobs, and if so, how. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Affect, Affective paradigm, Emotion, Information behaviour, Information communication technology, Information retrieval systems, Information services, IRS,,,,,,,"Adams, S.A., Quantitative research into organizational emotional intelligence as a predictor of organizational performance within the real estate industry (2011), PhD thesis, Capella University, Ann Arbor, MIAlbright, K., Multidisciplinarity in information behavior: Expanding boundaries or fragmentation of the field?

Design/methodology/approach: The interdisciplinary study program ""Advanced systems for libraries, archives and museums"", which is proposed will be disseminated to the 2011 graduates. An online questionnaire is generated and distributed to the engineering students and information science students. The research was developed at Transilvania University. Findings: The digital repository manager is a very important job for the future of the society. The engineering students proposed very precise topics in the field of IT, skills meant to predict the size of these databases and to assure fast information recovery systems, the ones from information science proposed topics for information management, copyright conditions and information security. This is the premise of creating an attractive curriculum. Research limitations/implications: The sample size limits the extent of statistical analyses and possible generalizations. The planned qualitative research may help in confirmation of the repository manager profiles. Originality/value: The proposed model may be generalized. The profile of the digital repositories manager is of great interest throughout the world. This paper describes a unique approach and could be transferred to other countries and communities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Archive management, Digital libraries, Digital repository, Digital storage, Information science, Marketing research, Open access, Quality management, Repository manager, Romania,,,,,,,"(2012) Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment, , www.aib.it/aib/boll/2009/0902139.htm, Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment, available at (accessed 14 May 2012) DRAMBORA; (2012) Networking European Scientific Repositories, , www.driver-repository.eu, DRIVER (accessed 12 May 2012); Space data and information transfer systems - open archival information system - reference model (2003), http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0b1.pdf, available at 14721 I.S.OSpace data and information transfer systems - audit and certification of trustworthly digital repositories (2011), http://wiki.digitalrepositoryauditandcertification.org/pub/Main/WebHome/652x0r1candidate-SOISOupdate-typoscorrected.doc, available at (accessed 13 May 2012) 16363 I.S.OKajberg, L., Lørring, L., (2005) European Curriculum Reflections on Library and Information Science Education, , Royal School of Librarianship and Information Science, Copenhagen; (2011), www.kcl.ac.uk/prospectus/graduate/details/name/digital_asset_management/alpha/d/header_search/, Digital Asset Management, London (Jacobs) (Cockburn) (Jones), available at Kings Royal College(2012) Romanian Information Science Community, DRAMBORA, , www.kosson.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222%3Adrambora-digital-repository-audit-method-based-on-risk-assessment&catid=22%3Aknow-how&Itemid=32&lang=ro; Kosson, (2012) Romanian Information Science Community, PLATTER - Planning Tool for Trusted Electronic Repositories, , www.kosson.ro/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=220%3Aplatter-planning-tool-for-trusted-electronic-repositories&catid=22%3Aknow-how&Itemid=32&lang=en; (2010) National Archives and Record Administration, available at, , www.archives.gov, NARA; (2012) Directory of Open Access, Statistics, , www.opendoar.org/, OpenDOAR available at (accessed 10 May 2012); (2011) Trusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsabilities, , 2002, RLG, Mountain View, CA RLG-OCLC; (2012) Registry of Open Access, Registry of Open Access Repositories, available at, , http://roar.eprints.org/, ROAR; Task force on information skills, information skills in higher education (1999), www.sconul.ac.uk/groups/information_literacy/papers/Seven_pillars.html, available at SCONUL(2006) Securing a Hybrid Environment for Research Preservation and Access, available at, , www.sherpa.ac.uk, SHERPA (accessed 10 May 2012); Zuccala, A., Oppenheim, C., Dhiensa, R., Managing and evaluating digital repositories (2008) Information Research, 333. , http:informationr.net/ir/13-1/paper333.html, available at; Swan, A., (2009) The Business of Digital Repositories, , Key Perspective Ltd, Truro","Repanovici, A.; Product Design and Environment Department, Transilvania University, Brasov, Romania; email: arepanovici@unitbv.ro",,,,,,,,7419058,,,,English,Libr.

Unfortunately, the recent change of the university program in Germany from the Diploma to the Bachelor/Master model had a direct negative impact on the curricula and the course schedules. The result of which is that the first-year curriculum is overloaded; exercises or practical courses have been dropped altogether from the first term, have been rescheduled to later terms and have been reduced in length. For this reason, other forms of experimenting have to be developed and integrated into the existing courses or lectures; virtual laboratories and remote experiments offer such an option: they enable students to access equipment 24h/7 days a week, they are independent from opening hours and the work schedule of the staff. Furthermore, simulations do have some other advantages: they provide a better control on the simulated phenomenon, allow observing effects and running experiments that are only very hard to measure or perform in practical applications. Another advantage besides their cost-efficiency is that simulations allow observations of effects in a simplified environment without any measurement errors. Therefore, remote and virtual experiments have already or will soon be set up by various universities across Europe. However, building a pool of experiments sufficient to cover all of undergraduate physics is an overwhelmingly complex and costly task for a single university to handle on its own. Therefore, the EUfunded LiLa project short for ""Library of Labs"" is building a network of virtual laboratories and remote experiments. The LiLa Portal provides access to manifold experiments, free to use in courses and lectures. Additionally, LiLa partners will profit from the experience gained from using remote experiments, and the LiLa network will provide best-practices in applications of remote experiments. This article starts with an introduction of LiLa and its aims; it then presents the integration of virtual labs and remote experiments into an existing course, ""Physics for Engineers"", at the University of Stuttgart. We introduce our concept for exercises with online-experiments and present some results of the pilot phase which took place in the winter term 2009/2010 and also some results on the winter term 2010/2011. © 2011 IEEE.",Online Course, Physics in Engineering Education, Remote Experiment, Virtual Laboratory,Cost,efficiency, First,year curriculum, Germany, Hands,on experiences, Negative impacts, Online course, Pilot Phase, Remote experiments, Undergraduate engineering course, Undergraduate engineering students, University programs, Virtual experiments, Virtual lab, Virtual laboratories, Work schedules, Curricula, Digital libraries, Education computing, Engineering education, Integration, Laboratories, Measurement errors, Profitability, Students, Technical presentations, Virtual reality, Experiments,,,,,,"Richter, Th., Boehringer, D., Jeschke, S., LiLa: A european project on networked experiments (2009) Proc. of REV 2009, , June Bridgeport, CT; Library of Labs, , http://www.lila-project.org/; (2009) Library of Labs, , EContentplus project EU grant ECP-2008-EDU-428037; Labview by National Instruments, , http://www.ni.com/labview, online documentation available at; Remote Farm TU Berlin, , http://remote.physik.tu-berlin.de/farm/; Khachadorian, S., Scheel, H., De Vries, P., Thomsen, C., Deployment of remote experiments - The OnPReX course at the TU berlin (2010) IEEE Conf. on Edu.

Cyril and Methodius University, Arhimedova bb, Macedonia","Advanced networking services, such as Intranet/Internet services can provide a basis for integration of knowledge and information on university level and in the same time provide a basis for distance education and learning. Huge production of teaching material each year, administrative and teaching information and library's collections need to be integrated on university level in knowledge and information university system. The process of integration must be improved with introduction of eLearning concepts and technologies, content unification, digital libraries standardization and information management integration in order to establish e-university (virtual university) environment and be closer to the knowledge society and globalization. At our university we have built an Integrated Intelligent (Agent-Based) University Information System - IABUIS consisting of the following four modules: Student Administration Management System (SAMS), Library Information System (LIS), Distance Learning System (DLS) and University Management Information System (UMIS). In this paper a model of a distance educational system with an embedded agent infrastructure and an agent based testing subsystem will be also presented. It is an agent based extension to the existing distance educational system for learning mathematics and informatics for pupils and students called MATHEIS (MATHematical Electronic Interactive System). This extension is an essential part of a Distance Learning System (DLS) and IABUIS. Recently, at the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, this system has been successfully integrated into ORACLE iLearning management system. The new iLearning/MATHEIS is agent-based and supports easy XML based import/export between applications, as well as SCORM and AICC based one-click import/export of the course metadata and content files. Similar integrations of intelligence in ORACLE iLearning management systems were not detected in a literature.

We focus on representing curriculum to enable the incorporation of digital resources into curriculum and curriculum sharing and customization by educators. We defined this model as a result of longitudinal studies on educators' development and customization of curriculum and user interface design studies of prototypes representing curriculum. Like overlay journals or the information network overlay model, our curriculum overlay model defines curriculum as a compound object with internal semantic relationships and relationships to digital library metadata describing resources. We validated this model by instantiating the model using science curriculum which uses digital library resources and using this instantiation within an application that, built on FEDORA, supports curriculum customization. Findings from this work can support the design of digital library services for customizing curriculum which embeds digital resources.

Spyridonos, 122 10 Egaleo, Greece","This paper attempts to present the current state of computer science penetration into librarianship in terms of both workplace and education issues. The shift from material libraries into digital libraries is mirrored in the corresponding shift from librarians into information scientists. New library data and metadata, as well as new automated library processes impose the need for a hybrid form of scientists, equipped with both the rich experience of traditional librarianship and the knowledge of modern techniques of information management based on information and communication technologies (ICT). In this context, the boundaries between computer scientists and information scientists are exercised in terms of research and vocational activities. The object of the computer scientist is hardware and software, which constitute the necessary background of the total information cycle, whereas the information scientist focuses on efficient ways of information organization, representation and management. The increasing job requirements of information scientists are taken into account in the formation of the upgraded educational curricula of Greek Library Science departments. An appendix of undergraduate and postgraduate curricula and career outcomes of some Library and Information Science departments is also given. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

Even though teaching is a mainstream, information-rich profession, teachers are understudied as information users. More specifically, not much is known about teacher personal information management (PIM). Teacher PIM is critically important, as teachers navigate a complex information space complicated by the duality of digital and physical information streams and changing demands on instruction. Our research study increases understanding of teacher PIM and informs the development of tools to support educators. Some important unknowns exist about teachers as information users: What are teachers' PIM practices? What are the perceived consequences of these practices for teaching and learning? How can PIM practices be facilitated to benefit teaching and learning? This study employed a qualitative research design, with interviews from 24 primary and secondary teachers. We observed various systems for information organization, and teachers report their systems to be effective. Important sources for teachers' information in order of importance are personal collections, close colleagues, and the Internet. Key findings reveal that inheriting and sharing information play an important part in information acquisition for teachers and that information technology supporting education creates unintentional demands on information management. The findings on the nature of teacher information, teacher information finding, keeping, and organizational practices have important implications for teachers themselves, school principals, digital library developers, school librarians, curriculum developers, educational technology developers, and educational policy makers. © 2014 ASIS&T.",information use, organization of information, personal information systems,Curricula, Digital libraries, Information management, Information use, Teaching, Information acquisitions, Information organization, Organization of informations, Organizational practices, Personal information management, Personal information systems, Physical information, Teaching and learning, Education,,,,,,"Barker, L.J., Science teachers' use of online resources and the digital library for Earth system education (2009) Proceedings of the 9th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, Austin, TX, , Paper presented at the; Barreau, D.K., Context as a factor in personal information management systems (1995) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 46 (5), pp. 327-339; Barreau, D., The persistence of behavior and form in the organization of personal information (2008) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 59 (2), pp. 307-317; Barreau, D., Nardi, B.A., Finding and reminding: File organization from the desktop (1995) SIGCHI Bulletin, 27 (3), pp. 39-43; Becker, H.J., Ravitz, J.L., Wong, Y., Teacher and teacher-directed student use of computers and software (1999) Teaching, Learning, and Computing: 1998 National Survey, , Report #3: Teaching Learning & Computing.

The increase of digital content in the broad areas of Institutional and domain specific Repositories, Libraries, Archives and Museums and the increased interest in the sharing and preservation of ""research data"" have triggered the emergence of new roles such as Data Curator. The paper refers about the on-going investigation of current data curator education and training programs with regard to the role of information professionals and/or data scientists in the research lifecycle. The investigation has been based on a series of workshops and events discussing the concerns of researchers and teachers about digital library and digital curation. A first list of competencies and skills at technical and operational level that professionals should have, has been evidenced. The theoretical framework and structure of educational programmes should have sufficient flexibility to accommodate the needs of various groups of specialists. © 2014 The Authors.

They have adopted information and communication technologies (ICT) to impart digital literacy skills to their students. An understanding of the use of ICT by the students helps in framing curriculum for the digital literacy course. A study of the use of various ICT tools and web based services by 135 students, registered for 3rd Semester of Master of Business Administration course in six institutions of higher education in Davanagere district, Karnataka State was undertaken during August 2012. Questionnaire was used as the data collection tool. The findings reveal that all the respondents own personal computer, and 73.33% of them have their own Internet connectivity. Laptop, smart phone, digital camera and I-pod are the most widely used tools. Computer and laptop are used for class work, study and research through internet, while smart phone, digital camera and I-pod are used mainly for personal purpose. Web portals are considered as major source of information about companies. Open access journals and institutional repositories are used to the least extent. E-mail and Facebook are the most widely used web-based services. Only 22.96% and 02.96% of the respondents are aware of the online databases in 'Capitaline' and 'IndiaStat' respectively. There is need to sensitize them to use web resources and web based services for research and academic purposes. Majority of them agree that information is easily available on internet, but, it needs to be evaluated before use. A model curriculum is proposed to impart digital literacy skills (basic and cognitive) to the students of Master of Business Administration.",Business administration, Digital literacy, ICT tools, Information literacy, Student community,,,,,,,"(2009) Globalization and Higher Education: What Might the Future Bring: Programme On Institutional Management In Higher Education, , www.oecd.org/edu/imhe, Organzation for Economic Co-operation and Development (O.E.C.D), International Forum for Higher educational Institutions; Geneva, Accessed on 20 January 2013); (2002) ICT and Teacher Education: A Planning Guide (UNESCO; Paris), p. 11. , 2United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation; Cuban, S.L., (2001) Oversold and Underused: Computers In the Classroom, p. 250. , Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA; (2013) Digital Strategy Glossary of Key Terms, , http://www.digitalstrategy.govt.nz/Media-Centre/Glossary-of-Key-Terms/, Accessed on30 February; Jones-Kavalier, Barbara, R., Flannigan Suzanne, L., Connecting the digital dots: Literacy of the 21st Century (2006) Educause Quarterly, 2, pp. 8-10; Karisiddappa, C.R., Rajgoli, I.U., Need for information literacy activities in the changing higher education environment in India (2005) Proceedings of the Paper Presented At the 51st All India Conference of Indian Library Association On Libraries, pp. 202-220. , Information Literacy and Life Long Learning, Kurushetra University, Kurukshetra, 16-18 December; Karisiddappa, C.R., Rajgoli, I.U., Inter-relationship among the libraries, information literacy and lifelong learning (2006) Karnatak University Journal of Social Sciences, 33, pp. 31-32; Karisiddappa, C.R., Rajgoli, I.U., Blooming knowledge society and information literacy in India (2007) Sri Lankan Journal of Librarianship and Information Management, 3 (1), pp. 1-13; Karisiddappa, C.R., Rajgoli, I.U., In search of information literacy programmes and practices: Survey of selected institutions in Bangalore (2008) DESIDOC Journal of Library and Information Technology, 28 (2), pp. 28-38; Tella, R., Best practices to promote information literacy in the digital era (2005) Proceedings of the Paper Presented At 23rd Annual Conference of Society For Information Science, pp. 681-690. , Andhra University; Visakhapatnam, 27-29 January; Krishna, G., Information literacy in digital era: A gateway to learning (2005) Proceedings of the Paper Presented At 23rd Annual Conference of Society For Information Science, pp. 691-699. , Andhra University; Visakhapatnam, 27-29 January; Rajgoli, I.U., Role of information literacy in digital information environment (2005) Proceedings of the Paper Presented At 23rd Annual Conference of Society For Information Science, pp. 700-710. , Andhra University; Visakhapatnam, 27-29 January; Mishra, C., Bulu, M., A survey of digital information literacy of Faculty of Sambalpur University (2007) Library Philosophy and Practice, 9 (2), pp. 1-9; Joshi, P.A., Satyaprakash, N., (2013) Mapping of Internet Information Literacy Among Faculty Members: A Case Study of Rajiv College of Engineering, , http://eprints.rclis.org/14375/, Accessed on 24 February; Babu, S.K., Sarada, B., Ramaiah, C.K., Use of Internet resources in the S.V.

There had been three approaches for module development in the past. The first approach was that the project team members created draft modules (total of 9) and then those modules were reviewed by the experts in the field as well as by other members of the team. The second approach was that graduate student teams developed modules under the supervision of an instructor and the project team. Four members in each team collaborated for a single module. In total four modules were produced in this way. The last approach was that five graduate students developed a total of five modules, each module reviewed by two students. The completed modules were posted in Wikiversity.org for wider distribution and collaborative improvements by the community.

Strategic approaches to course-content change in LIS have ranged from natural evolution to complete revision. This study, which is centred in the natural evolution approach, was undertaken as part of a larger study at the end of the decade to find factors that influenced LIS faculty to adopt innovations in course content and examine the extent to which faculty adopters had integrated an innovation in the courses they taught. The innovation chosen for the study was complex, related to processes that add value to Internet resources. The processes that constituted the innovation were selection of Internet resources, organization of Internet resources, Internet reference services, interface design in digital libraries, and user analysis in digital libraries. The results of a survey of LIS faculty in the United States and Canada showed that there were no differences among faculty adopters in the extent to which they had integrated the various Internet resource-based value-added processes. However, faculty members who were early in adopting the innovation had also integrated the innovation to a greater extent than did late faculty adopters. © The Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science.",Curriculum innovation, Internet resources, Lis courses, Lis education, LIS faculty,,,,,,,"Allard, S., Digital libraries: A frontier for LIS education (2002) Journal of Education for Library and Information Science, 43 (4), pp. 233-248; Ankem, K., Adoption of internet resource-based value-added processes by faculty in LIS education (2004) Library & Information Science Research, 26 (4), pp. 482-500; (2000) Library and Information Science Statistical Report, , http://ils.unc.edu/ALISE, Daniel, E.

Digital literacy or literacy in a digital environment?,2009,"8th European Conference on eLearning 2009, ECEL 2009",,,,672,678,,1,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2,s2.0,84901744758&partnerID=40&md5=7e854cb93669d377351a5ab28a6d84af,"Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium","Verhaaren, H., Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; De Meulemeester, A., Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium","Limited training in the use of Information Resources has been introduced in the curricula of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences since 2003. In the academic year 2008-2009 a structured course in Library and Information Sciences has been integrated in the curriculum of the first bachelor in Biomedical Sciences, preparing a research career. The aim of the course is digital literacy. Beside the theoretical teaching, e-learning and self-learning techniques (portfolio, chat box, wiki), were used to learn technical competences in word processing, presentation software and spreadsheet. Search strategies were intensively trained in smaller groups in the PC-room. This paper summarizes the examination results of 138 students coming directly from middle school (K12-level, after secondary school). Three components were separately graded: theoretical knowledge by oral interrogation; technical competences using portfolio and a spreadsheet application; search strategy by a literature task, almost identical to the search exercises instructed during the semester. For the search strategy a paragraph of a text was chosen to formulate context-sensitive research questions, one to be selected and answered using a factual database, another to be answered using three different bibliographic databases. The student had full access on his PC to lecture notes, digital library and the internet. Strict instructions were written on the first page of the examination folder. 66 % successfully passed the theoretical oral part, 81 % the spreadsheet exercise. Portfolio was satisfactory in 92 %. Literature searching, however, was less successful: 43% of the students were unable to distil correct research questions from the text. The choice of index terms from a standard thesaurus (MeSH, Medical Subject Headings, which is the structured thesaurus from NLM - National (US) Library of Medicine) was successful in 68%. Only 25% of the students made the correct choice for factual or bibliographic databases, depending on the question, and 25% of the students correctly used the three bibliographic databases, exactly as written in the instructions. Limits were poorly used to make a selection of the best possible hits, mainly language, recent years of publication and subject. Limitation by publication type was selected by as few as 19%. The bad performance in the search tasks can be explained by poor basic literacy and by lack of critical reading training. The low number of students capable to phrase correct questions, and the failure in choosing the right database, despite the access to teaching material and explicit instructions, reflects poor reading capability and lack of critical and integrative senses. To become digital literate and to take profit of the power of digital technology in learning, basic literacy is more important than technical competences. The overemphasis on digital software in middle school programs, neglecting basic literacy and critical text analysis skills, might become a negative factor in the use of present powerful data and information resources and explain the sometimes disappointing results of digital learning.",Competence testing, E,learning, Literacy skills, Performance,based assessment, Search strategies,Curricula, Digital libraries, Information services, Personnel training, Research, Spreadsheets, Students, Teaching, Thesauri, Vocabulary control, Word processing, Bibliographic database, Information resource, Library and information science, Literacy skills, Medical subject headings, Performance,based assessment, Search strategies, Spreadsheet applications, E,learning,,,,,,"(2000) Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, , American Library Association.

Institute, Worcester, MA, United States","The growing availability of online K-12 curriculum is increasing the need for meaningful alignment of this curriculum with state-specific standards. Promising automated and semi-automated alignment tools have recently become available. Unfortunately, recent alignment evaluation studies report low inter-rater reliability, e.g., 32% with two raters and 35 documents. While these results are in line with studies in other domains, low reliability makes it difficult to accurately train automatic systems and complicates comparison of different services. We propose that inter-rater reliability of broadly defined, abstract concepts such as 'alignment' or 'relevance' must be expected to be low due to the real-world complexity of teaching and the multidimensional nature of the curricular documents. Hence, we suggest decomposing these concepts into less abstract, more precise measures anchored in the daily practice of teaching. This article reports on the integration of automatic alignment results into the interface of the TeachEngineering collection and on an evaluation methodology intended to produce more consistent document relevance ratings. Our results (based on 14 raters × 6 documents) show high inter-rater reliability (61 - 95%) on less abstract relevance dimensions while scores on the overall 'relevance' concept are (as expected) lower (64%). Despite a relatively small sample size, regression analysis of our data resulted in an explanatory (R 2 = .75) and statistically stable (p-values &lt; .05) model for overall relevance as indicated by matching concepts, related background material, adaptability to grade level, and anticipated usefulness of exercises. Our results suggest that more detailed relevance evaluation which includes several dimensions of relevance would produce better data for comparing and training alignment tools.

The aim is to delineate the conditions necessary for e-learning to bring quality improvement in education and knowledge acquisition. Since 2002 several digital logistics were introduced to improve the educational process. The print library was transformed into a full digital information system, constantly available on the web. Next to broad online journal access, e-Books now cover the entire curriculum. A wide variety of bibliographic and factual databases, a fast working interlibrary loan system, dissertations database, open access sources, institutional archive and academic bibliography, easy access to instructional materials, are all available for our users. The library space has changed in a digital study-platform with 160 desk top computers, 100 of which in a networked e-class. The digital course system offers on-line communication with and between educators and learners, and includes group collaboration possibility, Wiki and portfolio. Software programs are available using server-based computing. Despite the introduction of appropriate technology, its use is incomplete and the overall quality outcomes in knowledge acquisition seem limited. After six years of availability of all these digital auxiliaries, only a limited number of courses offer interactivity. The content of the learning platform is greatly limited to syllabi and PowerPoint presentations; the contact education is given primarily in class lectures and tutorials. Moreover we observe a limited use of the offered information resources and facilities. And above all, we have no single indication that our students acquire more knowledge. Two major factors relate to quality outcomes: content management and cooperation/collaboration. For both factors we list examples of activities which might promote the educational outcomes: 1. Improvement of content management: Promote constantly resources and facilities, development of new educational digital resources, integrate digital resources in the curriculum, develop a (multi-centre?) archive of educational materials, constantly measure student workload (to avoid information overload), train the staff in the use of digital resources (students get formal education), develop alternative assessment methods 2. Better cooperation: Integrate the materials over individual courses (recognition and booster effects), change the expectancies and attitudes of both educators and learners, create a team responsibility for education, improve technical support for the teaching staff in the construction of digital learning output, train the educators in e-course and e-evaluation design. e-Learning certainly has the potential of improving the quality outcomes of education, but this depends largely on content management, and more importantly, on human commitment to intensively collaborate and network between all participants in the learning process.

Gathering syllabi that are freely available, and creating useful services on top of the collection, will yield a digital library of value for the educational community. However, gathering and building a repository of syllabi is complicated by the unstructured nature of syllabus representation and the lack of a unified vocabulary for syllabus construction. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to automatically annotate freely-available syllabi from the Web to benefit the educational community through supporting services such as semantic search. We discuss our detailed process for converting unstructured syllabi to structured representations through entity recognition, segmentation, and association. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our extractor and also suggest improvements. We hope our work will benefit not only users of our services but also people who are interested in building other genre-specific repositories. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,Curricula, Information retrieval, Students, World Wide Web, Genre,specific repositories, Structured representations, Structured syllabus repository, Metadata,,,,,,"Hodgins, W., Duval, E., Draft standard for learning technology - Learning Object Metadata - ISO/IEC 11404 (2002), Technical reportMccallum, A., Information extraction: Distilling structured data from unstructured text (2005) ACM Queue, 3 (9). , November; Thompson, C.A., Smarr, J., Nguyen, H., Manning, C., Finding educational resources on the web: Exploiting automatic extraction of metadata (2003) Proc.

It can be programmed in a variety of languages, including Java and C++. Since its initial release in 1996, dozens of papers have been written on its use in computer science education. In fact, a recent search for MindStorms in the ACM Digital Library produced 271 hits. Many of these papers describe its use, one way or another, in laboratory settings. Numerous workshops on its use in CS education have been held, attended by hundreds of faculty. Yet the platform's adoption is not as widespread as this level of interest would suggest. In fact, some early adopters of MindStorms have come to feel that the platform is not all that well suited to CS education, or at least that its supposed benefits have not been proven. This panel presents both pro and con positions on the use of MindStorms in CS education. Its goal is to engage the audience in a discussion of whether MindStorms can be used to good advantage as a pedagogical tool, and if so, in what contexts. The three panelists come to the discussion with differing experiences in using MindStorms in classes and with resulting differing views on its pedagogical usefulness. Michael Goldweber once employ MindStorms in his introductory courses, but has now come to believe that their use hinders learning. Barry Fagin is the developer of Ada for MindStorms, and has used MindStorms in a variety of course contexts. However, the results of a large study he ran showed no improvement in learning when MindStorms were used in introductory programming courses. Frank Klassner is the author of RCXLisp and has widely used MindStorms in his teaching. He remains a true believer in the pedagogical value of the MindStorms platform in CS education.

This study was conducted in April 2015 and surveyed undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students of various subjects at different universities. The aim was to investigate students’ format preferences when engaging with academic readings and what factors impact their preferences and behaviors. The comparative study will show whether students’ reading format preferences vary or remain consistent across multi-national student populations. We also make comparisons with results from an earlier study of Romanian and Norwegian students’ attitudes towards using academic libraries.

In this paper, we are interested in the semantic analysis of the content of the resources visited in the digital libraries (eBooks) by learners using domain ontology. The purpose of this analysis is to identify the domain concepts that are most consulted and read by learners from the digital libraries and to keep them into the leaner's model as concepts not well mastered. We hypothesize that all domain concepts visited in resources from the digital libraries can be considered as knowledge poorly or badly acquired by learners and merit thus more attention and consideration both by the tutor for the didactic monitoring of learners on these concepts and from author of course, to restructure and more enrich the educational content which articulate these concepts identified beforehand in this analysis. © 2014 IEEE.",conceptual indexing, Digital library, domain ontology, e,Learning, learner model,Curricula, Distance education, E,learning, Knowledge management, Learning systems, Semantics, Teaching, Conceptual indexing, Domain concepts, Domain ontologies, E,books, Educational contents, Learner model, Learning difficulties, Semantic analysis, Digital libraries,,,,,,"Stokes, P.J., How E-Learning will transform education (2000) Education Week, , www.edweek.org/ew/ewstory.cfm?slug=02stokes.h20; Nicholas, P., White, T., E-Learning, e-Books and Virtual Reference Service: The Nexus between the Library and Education (2012) Journal of Library & Information Services in Distance Learning, 6 (1), pp. 3-18; Daqing, H., Peng, Y., Mao, M., Alto, P., Wu, D., (2010) Supporting Information Access in E-learning by Integrating Digital Libraries and Ontology, 34 (5), pp. 704-728. , Emerald Group Publishing Limited 1468-4527; Rezaei Sharifabadi, S., How digital libraries can support elearning (2006) The Electronic Library, 24 (3), pp. 389-401. , http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/02640470610671231; Krishnamurthy, M., Digital library services at the Indian Statistical Institute (2005) The Electronic Library, 23 (2), pp. 200-203; Nur'ia Ferran, F., Enriching E-Learning metadata through Digital usage analysis (2007) The Electronic Library., 25 (2), pp. 148-216; A Working Definition of Digital Library, , http://old.diglib.org/about/dldefinition.html, Retrieved Janary 10, 2013 from, Digital Library Federation; Jeng, J., What is usability in the context of the digital library and how can it be measured?

An infusion of digital curation competencies into the LIS curriculum will ensure that students pursuing related professions-including archivists, museum technicians, librarians, and conservators-are also prepared to serve as stewards of our digital treasure. The unintended consequence of this approach may well be the sustainability of Digital Curation courses and, therefore, Digital Curation curricula.

Through core courses such as Information Organization, Information Seeking, and Information Technology, students ""dive deep"" into the content of a particular part of the field and learn the complex aspects of information practice. This emphasis on content separated into ""core"" courses can have the unintended consequence of making it difficult for students to integrate course content into their broader understanding of the profession. This two-part column explores the use of curriculum integrated with cloud-based instructional technology resources to create an active and hands-on setting that also helps students see relationships and interconnected aspects of information work. In discussing this approach, the author explores issues of student technology literacy and learning fatigue and discusses a technical framework for implementing technology-rich integrated curricula using a cloud-based virtual computing lab platform that maximizes positive aspects of an integrated curriculum while avoiding downsides associated with teaching in technology-rich settings.

Through core courses such as Information Organization, Information Seeking, and Information Technology students ""dive deep"" into the content of a particular part of the field and learn the complex aspects of information practice. This emphasis on content separated into ""core"" courses can have the unintended consequence of making it difficult for students to integrate course content into their broader understanding of the profession. In this two-part column the author explores the use of curriculum integrated support with cloud-based instructional technology resources to create an active and hands-on setting that also helps students see relationships and interconnected aspects of information work. In discussing this approach the author explores issues of student technology literacy and learning fatigue and discusses a technical framework for implementing technology-rich integrated curricula using a cloud-based virtual computing lab platform that maximizes positive aspects of an integrated curriculum while avoiding downsides associated with teaching in technology-rich settings. © Taylor & Francis.",computer science education, digital libraries, digital libraries alternative interface design and data publishing, education, information literacy, information science, information science education, information systems education and curriculum, multi,literacies, virtual computing labs,Curricula, Digital libraries, Distance education, Education, Information science, Information technology, Software design, Computer Science Education, Information literacy, Information science education, Information systems educations, Interface designs, multi,literacies, Virtual computing, Students,,,,,,"(2012) Internet2 NET+ CENIC Amazon Web Services (AWS) FAQ, , http://www.internet2.edu/netplus/docs/Internet2-CENIC-FAQ.pdf, CENIC; Mitchell, E., (2013) Computing labs in the cloud: A case study analysis of virtual computing in education; (2012) Frequently Asked Questions-Cloud Computing., , http://ptac.ed.gov/sites/default/files/cloud-computing.pdf, Privacy Technical Assistance Center., Washington, DC, Washington, DC,: U.S. Department of Education; Williams, A., Amazon Web Services Outage Caused By Memory Leak And Failure In Monitoring Alarm {pipe} TechCrunch (2012) Techcrunch, , http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/27/amazon-web-services-outage-caused-by-memory-leak-and-failure-in-monitoring-alarm/","Mitchell, E.; University of California, Berkeley, Doe 255, Berkeley, CA 94704, United States; email: emitchell@berkeley.edu",,,Routledge,,,,,7317131,,,,English,Tech.

Jan, J., Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Purpose - The purpose of this study was to provide quantitative indicators of intra-university assortative mixing patterns of scholars based on five parameters: Degree of connections, faculty, professional position, gender and race. Design/methodology/approach - We conducted a case study of business and management scholars of University of Malaya, a research-intensive University in Malaysia, using co-authorship in papers indexed in the Digital Library Indexing System, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) database of Web of Science, from 2006 to 2010. Background information of scholars was extracted from bibliometric records, online curriculum vitaes and other online sources. Assortativity coefficients were calculated for all parameters. Findings - The study found a degree assortativity coefficient of 0.195, which corresponds with other studies in the literature. Assortativity due to university faculty was strongly assortative at 0.649, whereas gender (0.28) and race (0.16) were weakly assortative. However, in contrast to the common belief that ""similarity breeds connection"", the scholars were highly disassortative by professional position (-0.75). Practical implications - This study holds significance to policymakers in understanding the socio-academic factors that bring scholars together. It also adds to the body of knowledge in social network studies that are examining the various factors responsible in bringing the actors together. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies that empirically investigated mixing patterns of researchers at a prominent research-intensive university in Malaysia. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Assortative mixing patterns, Business, Digital libraries, Malaysia, Management, Scholarly communications,,,,,,,"Barabasi, A.L., Bonabeau, E., Scale-free networks (2003) Scientific American, 288 (5), pp. 60-69; Barabasi, A.L., Jeong, H., Neda, Z., Ravasz, E., Schubert, A., Vicsek, T., Evolution of the social network of scientific collaborations (2002) Physica A-Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 311 (3-4), pp. 590-614; Burt, R.S., The contingent value of social capital (1997) Administrative Science Quarterly, 42 (2), pp. 339-365; Doherty, I.A., Schoenbach, V.J., Adimora, A.A., Sexual mixing patterns and heterosexual HIV transmission among African Americans in the Southeastern United States (2009) Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 52 (1), p. 114; Glänzel, W., Schubert, A., Analysing scientific networks through co-authorship (2005) Handbook of Quantitative Science and Technology Research, pp. 257-276. , Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht; Goodreau, S.M., Kitts, J.A., Morris, M., Birds of a feather, or friend of a friend?

The author's professional experience and research are used to highlight important practice trends such as digital libraries, embedded librarianship, broadening the audience for library and information services, involvement in problem-based learning, evidence based practice, end user searching of online databases, and the increasing need to conduct studies that link information services to key outcomes. The importance of tracking practice trends as part of the ongoing curriculum revision process is emphasized. Linking both education and research to practice will be crucial to the success of future educational programs and the ability of graduates to make a useful contribution in the workplace.

Unfortunately, the recent change of the university program in Germany from the Diploma to the Bachelor/Master model had a direct negative impact on the curricula and the course schedules. The result of which is that the first-year curriculum is overloaded; exercises or practical courses have been dropped altogether from the first term, have been rescheduled to later terms and have been reduced in length. For this reason, other forms of experimenting have to be developed and integrated into the existing courses or lectures; virtual laboratories and remote experiments offer such an option: they enable students to access equipment 24h/7 days a week, they are independent from opening hours and the work schedule of the staff. Furthermore, simulations do have some other advantages: they provide a better control on the simulated phenomenon, allow observing effects and running experiments that are only very hard to measure or perform in practical applications. Another advantage besides their cost-efficiency is that simulations allow observations of effects in a simplified environment without any measurement errors. Therefore, remote and virtual experiments have already or will soon be set up by various universities across Europe. However, building a pool of experiments sufficient to cover all of undergraduate physics is an overwhelmingly complex and costly task for a single university to handle on its own. Therefore, the EU-funded LiLa project - short for ""Library of Labs"" - is building a network of virtual laboratories and remote experiments. The LiLa Portal provides access to manifold experiments, free to use in courses and lectures. Additionally, LiLa partners will profit from the experience gained from using remote experiments, and the LiLa network will provide best-practices in applications of remote experiments. This article starts with an introduction of LiLa and its aims; it then presents the integration of virtual labs and remote experiments into an existing course, ""Physics for Engineers"", at the University of Stuttgart. We introduce our concept for exercises with online-experiments and present some results of the pilot phase which took place in the winter term 2009/2010 and also some results on the winter term 2010/2011. © 2011 IEEE.",Online Course, Physics in Engineering Education, Remote Experiment, Virtual Laboratory,Cost,efficiency, First,year curriculum, Germany, Hands,on experiences, Online course, Pilot Phase, Remote experiments, Undergraduate engineering course, Undergraduate engineering students, University programs, Virtual experiments, Virtual lab, Virtual laboratories, Work schedules, Curricula, Digital libraries, Education computing, Innovation, Integration, Laboratories, Profitability, Students, Technical presentations, Virtual reality, Experiments,,,,,,"Richter, Th., Boehringer, D., Jeschke, S., LiLa: A european Project on Networked Experiments Proc. of REV 2009.

A literature study was carried out on 23 scholarly papers and articles, retrieved from the ACM Digital Library and Library and Information Science Abstracts (LISA). The research questions were: - How do information workers keep and manage their information sources? - What aims do they have when building personal information collections? - What problems do they experience with the use and management of their personal collections? The main conclusion from the literature is that professional information workers use different tools and approaches for personal information management, depending on their personal style, the types of information in their collections and the devices which they use for retrieval. The main problem that they experience is that of information fragmentation over different collections and different devices. These findings can provide input for improvement of information literacy curricula in Higher Education. It has been remarked that scholarly research and literature on Personal Information Management do not pay a lot of attention to the keeping and management of (bibliographic) data from external documentation.

Where traditional blackboards have been replaced by virtual whiteboards and library books by online resources, teachers are trying hard to cope with the growing competition from technology outside the classroom that has captured their students' attention and imagination, with more technology, perhaps increasing student dependency. However, the author's previous research has shown that engaging e-learning tools to enhance student learning experience is not enough as it has negative impact on students' attitude towards e-cheating, disillusioning their awareness to cyber ethics. So, how do teachers ensure that the methods of teaching and the tools therewith truly enhance student learning and not affect their sense of ethics? As a part of an on-going research, this paper highlights the exponential usage of calculators in the classrooms and their impact on student' attitude towards e-cheating, and recommends further studies to measure the correlation of calculator dependency in the classroom to student attitude towards e-cheating and professionalism at workplaces. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",,E,learning tool, Educational institutions, Methods of teachings, Online resources, Preliminary studies, Student attitudes, Student learning, Student learning experiences, Curricula, Digital libraries, E,learning, Mathematical instruments, Philosophical aspects, Students, Teaching, Engineering education,,,,,,"Ament, P., Hand-held calculators (2007) The Great Idea Finder, , http://www.ideafinder.com, Troy MI url; Tout, N., (2009) Vintage Calculators, , http://inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www. vintagecalculators.com/, About.com.

This paper tries to find out what are the types of IT units in bachelor degree of LIS course in Indonesia. How does it fit the need of the information age? The research method is using curriculum observation through the universities official websites and interviewing some LIS coordinators. The author searched for IT units based on its name, description, and, cluster that available on the curriculum structure, and interviewed some LIS coordinators and lecturers regarding the curriculum structure. Following that, the data is classified into categories and finally each category is discussed. The research finding from 8 universities surveyed shows different portion of IT units. The range of the IT units offered in the curriculum is from 6 to 14 units. This is because each university has specialty that differ from one to another. However, those IT unit titles have similarity such as introduction to basic computer and information technology, information retrieval system, library automation, and digital library and web design. All of the IT units aim to support student skill in IT so they can help them handle the library and information job. This is only preliminary research, and there were still many areas that need to be covered. For further research, the involvement of the LIS course coordinators and IT lecturers is needed to discover and to gain in-depth information about the role of IT units in LIS education. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Also, this study investigates the linkage of library school graduates in Taiwan who took different levels of XML-related education (that is XML arranged as an individual course or XML arranged as a section unit in courses) and their professional qualification. Research questions include what is the availability of XML-related courses in countries in Taiwan and South East Asia? What are Taiwan LIS graduates' views on degree of XML-related courses satisfaction, cognition of learning XML technology, and views of XML-related courses? What is the linkage of Taiwan LIS graduates who studied different levels of XML-related education and their professional qualifications? This study applies 3 research methodologies: information gathering from the internet; questionnaire surveys; in-depth interviews. Results of the analysis show that LIS schools should provide optional XML-related courses with practical sessions, and library associations should provide regular XML-related continuing education to enhance LIS students' professional qualifications. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

Recent substantial advances in media authoring tools provide powerful platforms for academic content creation - by faculty and students alike. Leveraging these technologies in the service of education presents great promise, but also many challenges. In this workshop, we present hands-on training in the tools and strategies we have developed through the HigherEd 2.0 initiative. A four-university collaboration, HigherEd 2.0 encompasses digital content creation, digital library management, course deployment, and intervention evaluation. This workshop will address each of these elements, and include specific, hand-on training in multimedia development, course blog creation and management, and student creation of sharable digital course content. © 2010 IEEE.",Content creation, Evaluation of technology interventions, Multimedia, Social media,Academic content, Authoring tool, Content creation, Course contents, Digital content creation, Evaluation of technology, Hands,on,trainings, Library management, Multimedia, Multimedia development, Social media, University collaborations, Web 2.0, Curricula, Digital libraries, Engineering education, Social networking (online), Students, Technical presentations, Technology, Web services, Teaching,,,,,,"Ari, B., Iran's Twitter Revolution, , http://www.thenation.com/blogs/notion/443634, blog post at The Notion, 06/15/2009, accessed April 8, 2010; Meyer Richard, E., (2001) Multimedia Learning, , Cambridge University Press: New York","Berger, E.; School of Engineering and Applied Science, Virginia, United States; email: berger@virginia.edu",,American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE),Educational Research Methods (ERM) Division,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),IEEE Computer Society,IEEE Education Society,,"40th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference: Celebrating Forty Years of Innovation, FIE 2010",27 October 2010 through 30 October 2010,"Arlington, VA",83518,15394565,9781424462599,PFECD,,English,Proc.

To assess the performance of one of those tools and to gain insight into the differences between how human catalogers and automated tools conduct these standard assignments, we explore the use of network modeling and visualization techniques for comparing and contrasting the two. The results show significant differences between the human-based and machine-based network maps. Unlike the machine-based maps, the human-based assignment maps elegantly reflect the rationales and principles of the assignments; i.e., clusters of standards separate along lines of content and pedagogical principles. In addition, humans seem significantly more apt at assigning so-called 'methodological' standards. © 2010 IEEE.",Clustering, Human vs. Machine,based assignment, Network visualization, Standard assignment,Automated tools, Clustering, Educational standards, Gain insight, Human vs. Machine,based assignment, K,12 curriculum, Network maps, Network modeling, Network visualization, Pedagogical principles, Rapid growth, Visualization technique, Curricula, Digital libraries, Teaching, Visualization, Standardization,,,,,,"Bar-Ilan, J., Keenoy, K., Yaari, E., Levene, M., User Rankings of Search Engine Results (2007) J.

IT is the computing discipline for which the community of educators has most recently organized (as measured by milestones such as accreditation and development of a curriculum model). Sharing instructional materials and providing broader access to materials is an important step in continuing to develop a cohesive community of IT educators. At the same time, sharing materials is very difficult to do well. Faculty reward systems generally do not give much weight for any efforts that faculty members make to share their instructional materials with others. In addition, it is difficult to find the right form so that materials are easy to locate, and useful in contexts beyond the course for which they were developed. As organizer of this session, my interest in this topic is driven by the experience of leading an effort to create a BSIT degree program and obtain accreditation for it. My interest is also driven by current and prior work in several areas including: SWENET - SWENET is an NSF-funded repository of instructional materials related to software engineering. SWENET is a possible model for an IT materials collection. SWENET is located at http://swenet.org. IT 2008 - With the release of this curriculum model, there is a framework that could provide a basis for developing and organizing shared instructional materials. Ensemble - Ensemble is an NSF-funded effort to create a digital library to support all of computing education, including IT.

Conceptual graphs or knowledge maps of achievement standards reveal the macrostructure of the learning domain modeled by those standards and support higher-level understanding by teachers and students. The work builds on the conceptual framework of the AAAS knowledge maps by providing the means to flexibly define and deploy new relationship schemas to fit the disparate modeling needs of the nearly 740 learning standards documents in the ASN repository. Using an RDF-based, node-link representation of learning goals and the relationships among them, the ASN Knowledge Map Service will provide the framework to correlate educational resources to nodes in conceptual models in order to augment more conventional mechanisms of discovery and retrieval in digital libraries. © 2009 Springer.",Conceptual discovery, Content and curriculum standards, Digital libraries, Knowledge maps,Conceptual discovery, Conceptual frameworks, Conceptual graph, Conceptual model, Curriculum standards, Educational resource, Knowledge map, Learning goals, Learning objectives, Macrostructures, Node,link representation, On currents, Schemas, Curricula, Knowledge representation, Multi agent systems, Standards, Digital libraries,,,,,,"(1997) International Standard Classification of Education, , http://www.uis.unesco.org/TEMPLATE/pdf/isced/ISCED_A.pdf, United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); Sutton, S.A., Golder, D., Achievement Standards Network (ASN): An Application Profile for Mapping K-12 Educational Resources to Achievement Standards (2008) Proceedings of the International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications, pp. 69-79; O'Donnell, A.M., Dansereau, D.F., Hall, R.H., Knowledge Maps as Scaffolds for Cognitive Processing (2002) Educational Psychology Review, 14, pp. 71-86; NSDL Strand Maps, , http://knowledgemaps.nsdl.org/; Butcher, K.R., Bhusham, S., Sumner, T., Multimedia Displays for Conceptual Discovery: Information Seeking with Strand Maps (2006) Multimedia Systems, 11 (30), pp. 236-248; Sumner, T., Ahmad, F., Bhushan, S., Gu, Q., Molina, F., Willard, S., Wright, M., Janée, G., Linking Learning Goals and Educational Resources through Interactive Concept Map Visualizations (2005) International Journal of Digital Libraries, 5, pp. 18-24; (1993) Benchmarks for Science Literacy.

Design methodology/approach: A freely-distributed digitization toolkit was developed to assist with tracking and digitization of the distributed resources. In addition, on-site training was provided for most partners and was open for anyone in the area to attend. The strong emphasis on branding and presenting the same data within differently branded interfaces in the web presence encouraged greater participation of international partners. Findings: Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC), a joint project of the University of Florida, University of Virgin Islands and Florida International University in partnership with institutions in the Caribbean and circum-Caribbean, serves as the access point for scholars, students and citizens of interdisciplinary Caribbean and circum-Caribbean research and gathers together a critical mass of cultural, historical and research materials originally held in archives, libraries and private collections. Involving partners in the process of usability studies, as well as conducting internal usability studies, have also assisted in the creation of a successful project web interface. Practical implications: One concrete practical implication is the availability of a standards-based digitization toolkit, which can be freely used by non-members as well as members. Findings also suggest a course for digital library development in collaborative ventures. In addition, this case shows the benefits of the recurring, iterative process of performing usability studies during the development phase.

Design/methodology/approach: In order to bridge the digital and cultural divide in East Texas classrooms, TIDES has formed partnerships with institutions and educators from Mexico. By offering media rich resources, adapting current curriculum for today's digital environment, and fostering international partnerships, TIDES has built a model for an education program that promotes local and global understanding. Findings: Bringing together teachers from Mexico and Texas has resulted in a better understanding of each culture, which has translated to the classroom. These connections have been further supported by TIDES virtual expeditions, art projects, and primary source documents. Practical implications: Over time, TIDES has grown from a small, regional project to a university supported and sustained program. TIDES has pursued new ways the university library can contribute to the university community by forging partnerships in unexpected places. TIDES also offers unique opportunities for educators to travel on teacher expeditions, experiencing firsthand the cultures they are trying to relate to and teach about. Originality/value: This paper demonstrates unique ways that libraries and library staff can reach across the aisle to other departments and institutions, working together to increase access to and visibility of their services.

Indeed, funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) are actively seeking ways to integrate teachers and learners into the education cyber-infrastructure, whereby they become co-creators of educational content [2]. The ease with which this content, often in the form of online learning resources of varying levels of granularity, can be created and disseminated places it outside the usual peer review processes employed by publishers and professional societies. To date, digital library (DL) developers, teachers and school administrators, concerned whether teachers are using peer-reviewed online learning resources, have depended on one or a combination of the following proxies to establish an imprimatur of quality: the reputation and oversight of a funding organization (e.g., NSF's peer review process), the credentials of the content creator (e.g., National Science Teachers Association) or the collection development policies of specific DLs (e.g., DLESE). Now more than ever, though, sites such as YouTube, Flickr and ccMixter and the evolving education cyber-infrastructure, have created an environment where user-generated content is beyond the reach of even these proxy review processes. However, in the omnipresent climate of accountability within K12 education at U.S. federal, state and local levels, education DLs are being challenged to identify the value: of the resources they hold and services they provide to users; and, of what their users create with those resources. For all of these reasons, it is useful, and necessary, to develop a standardized rubric and process to review online education resources. In particular, this work should leverage social and technical networks to enrich, facilitate, and automate the review process. The Digital Libraries go to School project was funded by NSF in 2006 to develop a professional development workshop curriculum that enables teachers to use the Instructional Architect (IA; http://ia.usu.edu) to design their own learning activities for classrooms using online STEM resources from the National Science Digital Library (NSDL.org) and the wider Web. One component of the project is to examine the criteria and approaches for reviewing the quality of teacher-created online learning resources in order to develop a rubric and workflow process. Work to date includes conducting focus groups and surveys with teachers and a 5-person Expert Review Committee, complemented by a literature review to identify elements for a review rubric incorporating the work of other education DLs (e.g., DLESE, MERLOT, NEEDS, among others). Findings are being synthesized, and based on analysis, a draft list of elements has been identified for further testing in Spring 2008. At the same time, a workflow process for conducting reviews with teacher-created resources will be piloted. It will combine human-generated reviews with machine-generated information about online resources (e.g., image and word count; educational standards alignment; currency of updates, provenance) [3]. Further work will identify areas for improving the review rubric and scaling and standardizing the workflow process for Fall 2008. We will also evaluate the usefulness of the reviews to teachers, and to stakeholders such as the IA, NSDL, NSF and other DLs, in providing access to high-quality online content.",Education, Peer review,Collection development policies, Content creations, Content creators, Cyber infrastructures, Educational contents, Educational standards, Focus groups, Funding agencies, High qualities, Internet tools, K,12 educations, Learning activities, Literature reviews, National science digital libraries, National Science foundations, National science teachers associations, On,line contents, On,line educations, On,line resources, Online learning resources, Peer review, Peer,review process, Professional development workshops, Professional societies, Review process, School projects, Technical networks, User,generated contents, Workflow process, Youtube, Curricula, Digital libraries, E,learning, Internet, Libraries, Management, School buildings, Teaching, Ubiquitous computing, Education,,,,,,"Anderson, C., (2006) The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More, , Hyperion, New York, New York. 256 pp; (2005) Cyber-infrastructure for Education and Learning for the Future: A Vision and Research Agenda, , Computing Research Association, Washington, DC; Custard, M., Sumner, T., Using Machine Learning to Support Quality Judgments (2005) D-Lib Magazine, 11 (11)","Giersch, S.; National Science Digital Library, PO Box 3000, Boulder, CO 80307, United States; email: sgiersch@nsdl.ucar.edu",,,,"8th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2008, JCDL'08",16 June 2008 through 20 June 2008,"Pittsburgh, PA",74449,,9781595939982,,,English,Proc ACM Int Conf Digital Libr,Conference Paper,Scopus,2,s2.0,57649174618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial phase of the work included an ITiCSE working group that gathered a great deal of literature on and about: computing research; CRM; and teaching CRM [3]. During the literature review, we discovered a number of similar current and prior efforts, some of which had even met with limited success within their discourse community. However, because the CRM literature is divided across publishers, indices, and discourse communities, none of the earlier efforts established the common ground necessary for meaningful dialog on curricular issues (see section 1.1. of [1]) To establish that common ground, we decided to foster a scholar-produced digital resource to facilitate integrating teaching / learning research methods across the computing curriculum [1]. Scholar-produced digital resources are digital libraries that are produced by scholarly communities of practice, rather than by external stakeholders such as commercial publishers or libraries. These digital libraries are rich interactive web locales that "". . . include aggregations of resources that support research, such as field-based topic gateways and bibliographies; products of original research such as novel multimedia publications and handbook type web publications, communication forums such as preprint archives and pure e-journals; and research tools such as non-proprietary software available via the web."" [2] We started work on the CRM Multi-Perspective Digital Library (CRM-MPDL) in early 2007. A second ITiCSE working group [1] focused on the faculty perspectives in CRM-MPDL. A SIGCSE special projects grant funded student research assistants for CRM-MPDL. As a consequence, students have become a very active and vocal constituency in the project, and they have made significant progress on a set of student design and content elements for CRM-MPDL. To date, we have developed an international participatory design community [4]; conducted and published an extensive literature review and glossary [3]; developed some initial curricular materials [4]; and constructed a prototype design for the faculty perspective in a multiperspective digital resource to integrate teaching research methods across the computing curriculum [1]. One of the goals of the project has been to build a tool that is useful to faculty, students, industry, administrators, and anyone else who is interested in teaching or learning about CRM. A prototype of CRM-MPDL is ready to be tested, interacted with, and critiqued. The goal of this poster is to solicit participation from the ITiCSE conference attendees. An international audience is necessary for us to get the most comprehensive feedback for the tool. We have a growing set of content materials and a growing set of design materials. A laptop will be available at the poster for attendees to experience CRM-MPDL on site.",Computing research methods, Curricular issues, Participatory design, Scholar,produced digital resource,Common grounds, Communication forums, Communities of practices, Computing curriculums, Computing research methods, Computing researches, Curricular issues, Curricular materials, Design materials, Design researches, Digital resources, External,, Literature reviews, On sites, Or libraries, Participatory design, Participatory designs, Preprint, Proprietary softwares, Prototype designs, Research methods, Research tools, Scholar,produced digital resource, Student researches, Working groups, Agglomeration, Computers, Curricula, Design, Digital arithmetic, Education, Education computing, Innovation, Laptop computers, Libraries, Multimedia systems, Project management, Students, Systems analysis, Teaching, World Wide Web, Digital libraries,,,,,,"Applin, A.G., Holz, H.J., Joel, W., Okoye, I., Deibel, K., Grasser, B., Oates, B.J., Wood, G., A multi-perspective digital library to facilitate integrating teaching research methods across the computing curriculum (2007) SIGCSE Bull, 39 (4), pp. 184-203; Fry, J., Talja, S., The intellectual and social organization of academic fields and the shaping of digital resources (2007) J.

In the distributed architectural design, each forum server is fully equipped with the ability to support some course forums independently. The forum servers collaborating with each other constitute the whole forum system. Therefore, the workload of the course forums can be shared by a group of the servers. With the secure group communication protocol and fault tolerance design, the new distribution framework provides a robust and scalable distributed architecture for the large course forum system. The forum servers can be settled in anywhere as long as a broadband network connection to Internet is provided. Our experimental performance testing results show that the large forum system is a high performance distributed system with very low communication overhead cost. In addition, all course forums are classified by their teaching content relevance. Relevant course forums can be arranged on the same forum server together. Hence our distribution framework also provides a knowledge-based taxonomic storage solution to build a large digital course teaching material library.

Su et al (2005) discuss the difficulties many teachers face when working with new technologies in trying to encourage interaction at a distance, where learning new software, and finding the time to innovate and persist with new ways of using the affordances of online environments for learning, take their toll in a busy schedule. As a result the opportunities for interaction may be few in reality, because the designed elements are replicated from face-to-face teaching experience and teachers are unsupported in their technology learning. The paper explores the experience of developing an online course for final year undergraduate learning, staffed by UK teachers and delivered to students in South Africa and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Two semesters are contrasted, where the design elements available in the first semester (web pages, hotlinks, online library facilities and asynchronous conferencing in addition to core texts) were supplemented on the basis of student feedback reporting lack of personalised response and detailed explanation. In the second semester, module leaders were asked to learn new software to develop video lectures (based on Powerpoint™ with visual and audio commentary), improved scheduling of synchronous livechat sessions and weekly summary webcasts, which could be downloaded or streamed as movies or audio podcasts. Interviews with the teachers concerned evaluate the move to a richer online design, particularly in relation to students' choices about which elements to use. Increasing the video and webcast-mediated relationship between learner and teacher appeared to have the effect of reducing text-based contact in asynchronous forums. Was this moving away from the very essence of collaborative and interactive online learning back to a passive distance model?.",Distance learning, Learning approaches, Learning design, VLE,Broadcasting, Curricula, Digital libraries, Distance education, Education, Engineering education, Internet, Online conferencing, Social networking (online), Students, Teaching, Websites, Interactive learning, Learning approach, Learning designs, Online environments, Technology learning, Undergraduate Courses, United Arab Emirates, VLE, E,learning,,,,,,"Coomey, M., Stephenson, J., Online learning: It's all about dialogue, involvement, support and control (2001) Teaching and Learning Online 2001, , Stephenson, J. ed, Kogan Page: London; Entwistle, N., Styles of learning and approaches to studying in higher education (2001) Kybernetes, 30 (5-6), pp. 593-602; Garrison, D.R., Shale, D., (1990) Education at a Distance: From Issues to Practice, , Krieger: Melbourne, FL; Garrison, R., Theoretical challenges for distance education in the 21st century: A shift from structural to transactional issues (2000) The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning, 1 (1). , http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/2/333, Accessed: February 2008; Holmberg, (1989) Theory and Practice of Distance Education, , Routledge: London; Moore, M.G., Editorial: Three types of interaction (1989) American Journal of Distance Education, 3 (2), pp. 1-7; Moore, M.G., Recent contributions to the theory of distance education (1990) Open Learning, 5 (3), pp. 10-15; Nixon, T., Salmon, G., Computer-mediated learning and its potential (1996) Supporting the Learner in Open and Distance Learning, , Mills, R. and Tait, A. eds, Pitman Publishing: London; Sims, R., Promises of interactivity: Aligning learner perceptions and expectations with strategies for flexible and online learning (2003) Distance Education, 24 (1); Stodel, E.J., Thompson, T.L., MacDonald, C.J., Learner's perspectives on what is missing from online learning: Interpretations through the community of inquiry framework (2006) International Journal of Research in Open and Distance Learning, Athabasca University, 7 (3); Su, B., Bonk, C.J., Magjuka, R.J., Liu, X., Lee, S.-H., The importance of interaction in web-based education: A program-level case study of online MBA courses (2005) Journal of Interactive Online Learning, 4 (1)",,Remenyi D.,,Academic Conferences Limited,"3rd International Conference on e-Learning, ICEL 2008",26 June 2008 through 27 June 2008,,113216,20488882,9781906638047,,,English,"Proc.

Universities have a unique place in this education process since demand grows for IT staff qualified to various levels, particularly basic or foundation levels, in these standards.

It then presents preliminary findings from an application of this model in which teachers' artifacts are analyzed to learn how online learning resources are used in situ. Initial results suggest that learning resources of a smaller granularity are more likely to be adapted or improvised upon in teacher-designed learning activities, which further supports teachers' becoming contributors of online resources and active participants in an education cyberinfrastructure.

Aligning standards from different states promises to help teachers in one state find appropriate materials created and cataloged elsewhere. Although such alignments provide a powerful means for crosswalking standards and curriculum across states, alignment matrices are intrinsically sparse. Hence, we hypothesize that such sparseness may cause significant numbers of false negatives when used for searching curriculum. Our preliminary results confirm the false negative hypothesis, demonstrate the usefulness of term-based techniques in addressing the false negative problem, and explore ways to combine term occurrence data with standards correlations.

The improvements of disability-related policy in tertiary environments have resulted in measurable improvements in the adoption of Universal design concepts in the development of print and electronic curriculums. Yet despite this progress in policy, many tertiary institutions face a notable lack of practical policy implementation. People who are blind or vision impaired struggle in the Tertiary environments due to inadequate resources and technical expertise in the support structure. In order to take a proactive approach towards this issue, Curtin University of Technology recently completed pilot project to develop the necessary procedures, tools and training (staff and students) that addresses difficulties faced by this important group of students. The overall aim of the project was to identify the issues confronting students with a vision impairment at Curtin University, as well as the issues and factors that could contribute to their success at tertiary education. These include the provision of training to educators, the creation of alternative electronic information and the provision of accessible library and information resources. ©2006 IEEE.",Accessibility, Disability, Vision impaired,"(R ,s ,S) policy; Accessible information; Curtin University; Electronic information; Higher education (HE); In order; Information resources; international conferences; pilot projects; Pro-active approach; Support structures; technical expertise; Technology based; Tertiary education; Universal design (UD); Vision impaired; Vision impairments; Design; Digital libraries; Education; Information technology; Personnel training; Students; Technology; Teaching",,,,,,"Australian Bureau of Statistics.

The ultimate goal is to better support the cognitive process of turning the abundance of explicit knowledge into useful implicit (tactile) knowledge. We argue that carrying explicit information around, e.g. in form of a notebook, is an obsolete approach in the age of networking. We suggest, as large size displays and input devices become freely available in many locations on and off campus, it is sufficient to connect to them via a remote control which could be a PDA or a mobile phone (which in the future will be one and the same anyway). This paper illustrates some of the architectural requirements, identifies desirable interaction conventions and proposes suitable changes to our educational practices.",Knowledge Acquisition, Mobility, Multimedia in Education, PDA,Character recognition, Cognitive systems, Computer architecture, Curricula, Digital libraries, Education, HTML, Large scale systems, Local area networks, Mobile telecommunication systems, Multimedia systems, Personal digital assistants, Mobility, Multimedia in education, Knowledge acquisition,,,,,,"Borgman, C.L., (2000) From Gutenberg to the Global Information Infrastructure: Access to Information in the Networked World, , Cambridge, MA; London: MIT Press; Rowley, J.E., Farrow, J., (2000) Organizing Knowledge: An Introduction to Managing Access to Information, 3rd Ed., , Aldershot, Hampshire, England; Burlington, VT: Gower; Svenonius, E., (2000) The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization, , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Brown, J.S., Duguid, P., (2000) The Social Life of Information, , Boston: Harvard Business School Press; Bloch, R.H., Hesse, C.A., (1995) Future Libraries, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Wille, R., Begriffliche Wissensverarbeitung: Theorie und Praxis (2000) Informatik Spektrum, 23 (6), pp. 357-369. , Dec; Devlin, K., (1999) Infosense, Turning Information into Knowledge, , New York: Freeman; Takeuchi, H., Nonaka, I., (1995) The Knowledge-creating Company, How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation, pp. 56-94. , London: Oxford University Press; Staab, S., Wissensmanagement mit Ontotogien und Metadaten (2002) Informatik-spektrum, 25 (3), pp. 194-209. , June; http://www.kmconnection.com/DOC100111.htmWegner, L., Teaching an Old Course New Tricks: A Portable Courseware Language Based on XML (2003) Computer Science in Perspective, pp. 343-355. , Klein, Six, Wegner (Eds.), Heidelberg: Springer LNCS 2598; Wegner, L., Ahmad, M., Schmidt, Ch., Fröhlich, S., Evers, W., A Collaborative Infrastructure for Mobile and Wireless Systems (2001) Developing an Infrastructure for Mobile and Wireless Systems, pp. 136-145. , B.

In what we have defined as a distributed archive for re-useable learning objects, teachers and learners may draw from reputable content sources and concentrate on the value-added activities of devising learning paths, conducting assessments and carrying out collaboration. We believe that we have an architecture that will fulfill the above objective. The paper first articulates the rationale for such an approach, then reviews the relevant work of others, and finally presents our architecture for the e-learning trials being carried out at our institution.
