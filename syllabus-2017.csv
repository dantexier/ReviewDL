In this paper, we report on our work towards creating a syllabus repository of Computer Science courses across universities in the USA. We present some statistics from our initial collection of 8000+ syllabi. We show a syllabus creator that is integrated with Moodle [5], an opensource course management system, which allows for the creation of a syllabus for a particular course. Among other information, it includes knowledge units from the Computing Curricula 2001 body of knowledge. The goal of the syllabus repository is to provide added value to the Computer Science Education community, and we present some such offerings. We conclude by presenting our future plans for the syllabus repository. These include using automated techniques to collect and classify syllabi, providing recommendations to instructors when creating a syllabus, and allowing the community to share their syllabi automatically. The syllabus collection will be part of the Computing and Information Technology Interactive Digital Educational Library (CITIDEL), a collection of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL).

In this paper we introduce a new method for automatic text classification for categorizing E-documents by utilizing classification metadata of books, journals and other library holdings, that already exists in online catalogues of libraries. The method is based on identifying all references cited in a given document and, using the classification metadata of these references as catalogued in a physical library, devising an appropriate class for the document itself according to a standard library classification scheme with the help of a weighting mechanism. We have demonstrated the application of the proposed method and assessed its performance by developing a prototype classification system for classifying electronic syllabus documents archived in the Irish National Syllabus Repository according to the well-known Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) scheme. © 2009 Springer.",Bibliography; Collective classification; Digital library organization; Library classification schemes; Text classification,Automatic text classification; Classification scheme; Collective classification; Dewey decimal classifications; e-Documents; Electronic document; Online catalogue; Prototype classification; Standard libraries; Text classification; Bibliographies; Metadata; Security of data; Text processing; Word processing; Digital libraries,,,,,,"Avancini, H., Rauber, A., Sebastiani, F., Organizing Digital Libraries by Automated Text Categorization International Conference on Digital Libraries, ICDL 2004, New Delhi, India (2004); Sebastiani, F., Machine learning in automated text categorization (2002) ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 34 (1), pp. 1-47; Golub, K., Automated subject classification of textual Web pages, based on a controlled vocabulary: Challenges and recommendations (2006) New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia, 12 (1), pp. 11-27; Yi, K., Automated Text Classification Using Library Classification Schemes: Trends, Issues, and Challenges (2007) International Cataloguing and Bibliographic Control (ICBC), 36 (4); Dewey, M., (1876) Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC), , http://www.oclc.org/us/en/dewey, OCLC Online Computer Library Center cited January 2008; Putnam, H., Library of Congress Classification (LCC) (1897) Library of Congress, Cataloging Policy and Support Office, , http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcc.html, cited January 2008; (2002), http://www.oclc.org/research/software/scorpion/default.htm, ScorpionLarson, R.R., Experiments in automatic Library of Congress Classification (1992) Journal of the American Society for Information Science, 43 (2), pp. 130-148; Jenkins, C., Automatic classification of Web resources using Java and Dewey Decimal Classification (1998) Computer Networks, 30 (1-7), pp. 646-648; Dolin, R., Agrawal, D., Abbadi, E.E., Scalable collection summarization and selection Proceedings of the Fourth ACM Conference on Digital Libraries, Berkeley, California, United States (1999); Chung, Y.M., Noh, Y.-H., Developing a specialized directory system by automatically classifying Web documents (2003) Journal of Information Science, 29 (2), pp. 117-126; Pong, J.Y.-H., Kwok, R.C.-W., Lau, R.Y.-K., Hao, J.-X., Wong, P.C.-C., A comparative study of two automatic document classification methods in a library setting (2008) Journal of Information Science, 34 (2), pp. 213-230; Frank, E., Paynter, G.W., Predicting Library of Congress classifications from Library of Congress subject headings (2004) Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology, 55 (3), pp. 214-227; Joorabchi, A., Mahdi, A.E., A New Method for Bootstrapping an Automatic Text Classification System Utilizing Public Library Resources Proceedings of the 19th Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science, Cork, Ireland (August 2008); Sen, P., Namata, G.M., Bilgic, M., Getoor, L., Gallagher, B., Eliassi-Rad, T., (2008) Collective Classification in Network Data, , http://hdl.handle.net/1903/7546, Technical Report CS-TR-4905, University of Maryland, College Park; Joorabchi, A., Mahdi, A.E., Development of a national syllabus repository for higher education in ireland (2008) LNCS, 5173, pp. 197-208. , Christensen-Dalsgaard, B., Castelli, D., Ammitzbøll Jurik, B., Lippincott, J.

The aim is to delineate the conditions necessary for e-learning to bring quality improvement in education and knowledge acquisition. Since 2002 several digital logistics were introduced to improve the educational process. The print library was transformed into a full digital information system, constantly available on the web. Next to broad online journal access, e-Books now cover the entire curriculum. A wide variety of bibliographic and factual databases, a fast working interlibrary loan system, dissertations database, open access sources, institutional archive and academic bibliography, easy access to instructional materials, are all available for our users. The library space has changed in a digital study-platform with 160 desk top computers, 100 of which in a networked e-class. The digital course system offers on-line communication with and between educators and learners, and includes group collaboration possibility, Wiki and portfolio. Software programs are available using server-based computing. Despite the introduction of appropriate technology, its use is incomplete and the overall quality outcomes in knowledge acquisition seem limited. After six years of availability of all these digital auxiliaries, only a limited number of courses offer interactivity. The content of the learning platform is greatly limited to syllabi and PowerPoint presentations; the contact education is given primarily in class lectures and tutorials. Moreover we observe a limited use of the offered information resources and facilities. And above all, we have no single indication that our students acquire more knowledge. Two major factors relate to quality outcomes: content management and cooperation/collaboration. For both factors we list examples of activities which might promote the educational outcomes: 1. Improvement of content management: Promote constantly resources and facilities, development of new educational digital resources, integrate digital resources in the curriculum, develop a (multi-centre?) archive of educational materials, constantly measure student workload (to avoid information overload), train the staff in the use of digital resources (students get formal education), develop alternative assessment methods 2. Better cooperation: Integrate the materials over individual courses (recognition and booster effects), change the expectancies and attitudes of both educators and learners, create a team responsibility for education, improve technical support for the teaching staff in the construction of digital learning output, train the educators in e-course and e-evaluation design. e-Learning certainly has the potential of improving the quality outcomes of education, but this depends largely on content management, and more importantly, on human commitment to intensively collaborate and network between all participants in the learning process. Technology alone cannot produce any real beneficial effect on knowledge acquisition. Technology without added value is not worth the effort and investment.",Cooperation; Course content; Curriculum design; Educational technology; Faculty development; Outcomes of education,Bibliographies; Computer science; Curricula; Digital libraries; Educational technology; Engineering education; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Technology; Appropriate technologies; Cooperation; Course contents; Curriculum designs; Faculty development; Instructional materials; Power Point presentations; Server-based computing; E-learning,,,,,,"Ellaway, R., Masters, K., AMEE Guide 32: e-Learning in medical education Part 1: Learning, teaching and assessment (2008) Medical Teacher, 30 (5), pp. 455-473; Fagerberg, J., Mowery, D.C., Nelson, R.R., The Oxford Handbook of Innovation (2004), Oxford University Press, Oxford, UKHarden, R.M., Crosby, J.R., Davis, M.H., AMEE Guide 14: Outcome-based education: Part 1: An introduction to outcome-based education (1999) Medical Teacher, 21 (1), pp. 7-14; Shaping Europe's future through ICT (2006), ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/ist/docs/istag-shaping-europe-future-ict-march-2006-en.pdf, ISTAG, Information Society Technologies Advisory GroupMasters, K., Ellaway, R., AMEE Guide 32: e-Learning in medical education Part 2: Technology, management and design (2008) Medical Teacher, 30 (5), pp. 474-489; Mcneil, H.P., Hughes, C.S., Toohey, S.M., Dowton, S.B., An innovative outcomes-based education program built on adult learning principles (2006) Medical Teacher, 28 (6), pp. 527-534; Richter, D., Sinclair, N., The Bermuda Triangle in Education: navigating objectives, content and assessment so that learning and students don't disappear (2006), http://hsc.unm.edu/som/ted/, online, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NMSefton, A.J., New approaches to medical education: an international perspective (2004) Medical Principles and Practice, 13 (5), pp. 239-248; Steinert, Y., Mann, K., Centeno, A., Dolmans, D., Spencer, J., Gelula, M., Prideaux, D., A systematic review of faculty development initiatives designed to improve teaching effectiveness in medical education (2006) Medical Teacher, 28 (6), pp. 497-526. , BEME Guide No 8; Wilkerson, L., Irby, D.M., Strategies for improving teaching practices; a comprehensive approach to faculty development (1998) Academic Medicine, 73 (4), pp. 387-396","Verhaaren, H.; Ghent UniversityBelgium; email: henri.verhaaren@ugent.be",,,Academic Conferences Limited,"7th European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL 2008",6 November 2008 through 7 November 2008,Agia Napa,103307,,,,,English,"Proc.

Gathering syllabi that are freely available, and creating useful services on top of the collection, will yield a digital library of value for the educational community. However, gathering and building a repository of syllabi is complicated by the unstructured nature of syllabus representation and the lack of a unified vocabulary for syllabus construction. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to automatically annotate freely-available syllabi from the Web to benefit the educational community through supporting services such as semantic search. We discuss our detailed process for converting unstructured syllabi to structured representations through entity recognition, segmentation, and association. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our extractor and also suggest improvements. We hope our work will benefit not only users of our services but also people who are interested in building other genre-specific repositories. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,Curricula; Information retrieval; Students; World Wide Web; Genre-specific repositories; Structured representations; Structured syllabus repository; Metadata,,,,,,"Hodgins, W., Duval, E., Draft standard for learning technology - Learning Object Metadata - ISO/IEC 11404 (2002), Technical reportMccallum, A., Information extraction: Distilling structured data from unstructured text (2005) ACM Queue, 3 (9). , November; Thompson, C.A., Smarr, J., Nguyen, H., Manning, C., Finding educational resources on the web: Exploiting automatic extraction of metadata (2003) Proc.

Recently, the OUJ started to implement ICT, including Web-based delivery of courses and online registration, but these options have not been fully utilized by students. This is mainly because some older students at the OUJ had little experience in using PCs and/or the Internet. To prepare students to use the Internet and maximize Web-based learning opportunities, the OUJ began offering a digital literacy training (DLT) course at each study center in October 2010 as a 12-hour intensive course, using standardized teaching materials and a common syllabus. A series of checklist surveys was conducted before and after each course to measure the learning outcomes and perceived self-efficacy of the students. Learning outcomes and student perceptions of their digital skills were significantly improved. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",Digital literacy training; faculty development; information literacy for adults; lifelong learning,Computer aided instruction; Digital libraries; Information science; Personnel training; Students; Teaching; Digital literacies; Faculty development; Information literacy; Life long learning; Online registration; Perceived self-efficacy; Student perceptions; Web-based delivery; E-learning,,,,,,"Zurkowski, P.C., (1974) The Information Science Environment: Relationships and Priorities.
